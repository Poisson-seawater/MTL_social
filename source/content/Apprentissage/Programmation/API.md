**API stands for Application Programming Interface.**

APIs are created to help software applications to communicate with each other.

If HTTP is a language for communication between different systems, then API is a language for communication between different applications.


The **API defines how users can access the services provided**, for both the app and the hotel.

**API endpoints** specify where to find these services so you can access them. Think of them as the hotel doors that allow you to enter the restaurant, or the swimming pool for a nice swim after a day of automating with Make.
