If you want to log time in a Linux terminal to learn commands, shell scripting, Python, and the basics of web development, a free shell account is an easy, no-cost way to get started. Here's a short list to try:
-> [10 ways to get started with Linux | Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/ways-get-started-linux)
- [Freeshell.de](https://freeshell.de/) is a public access Linux system that's been online since 2002. You get SSH access (to experiment in a Linux shell), IPv6, and OpenSSL, and you can request a MySQL database.
- [Blinkenshell](https://blinkenshell.org/wiki/Start) provides a Linux shell to learn Unix, use IRC, host simple websites, and share files. It's been online since 2006.
- [SDF Public Access Unix System](https://sdf.org/) was established in 1987 to offer free NetBSD accounts. NetBSD isn't Linux, of course, but it's open source Unix, so it offers a similar experience. It also has several homebrewed applications, so it straddles the line between old-school BBS and plain-old free shell.

Free shell accounts are subject to a lot of abuse, so the more you demonstrate trustworthiness and willingness to participate in the goings-on of the collective, the better your experience. You can often gain access (through a special request or a small donation to demonstrate goodwill) to database engines, compilers, and advanced programming languages. You can also ask for additional software or libraries to be installed, subject to administrator approval.
