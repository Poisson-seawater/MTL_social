the 4 level of the mind
- **Conscious:** transfers toxic thoughts from the nonconscious mind by deconstructing and reconstructing them.
- **Subconscious:** “just aware” level where thoughts move from the nonconscious to the conscious mind.
	- think of a huge forest, each tree is an experience. 
		- And it try to push to the conscious mind the sick tree.
		- it's a bridge between nonconscious and conscious.
- **Unconscious:** only works when we are asleep or out of consciousness
	- another concept Freud popularized, consists of deeply buried memories, drives, and feelings, often repressed due to their troubling nature. These unconscious elements shape behaviors and attitudes indirectly, emerging in dreams or "slips."
-  **Nonconscious:** scans all the information,
	- works 24/7. 
	- respond life when awake
	- process and shorts out information when sleep


###### **Nonconscious**: 
This term often refers to processes entirely outside of awareness that never enter consciousness. It includes automatic bodily functions, like heartbeat regulation, as well as perceptual and cognitive processes the brain handles without us noticing, like filtering sensory input.
