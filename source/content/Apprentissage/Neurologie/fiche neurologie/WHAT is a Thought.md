*Thoughts are like trees, rooted in experiences and branching out into interpretations. And we have can shape and mold them thought the process of neuroplasticity.*

1. Our thoughts are **physical structures in the brain made of proteins**, and they look like trees:
	- The roots are the experience memories.
	- The branches are the interpretations of the experiences.
2. **Neuroplasticity** is the ability to use our minds to change our brains.

**Intrusive thought** are like a volcano, it erupt, destroy everything. Then remineralized the soil. Then the volcano go extinct.
