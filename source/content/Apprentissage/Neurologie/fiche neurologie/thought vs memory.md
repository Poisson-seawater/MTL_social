**Experience** are store as **[[WHAT is a Thought|Thought]]**, construct like protein. Like a tree with root, branches, tronc ... the tree make the **memory**. 
HENCE **thoughts** are made of memory.
The whole of the tree is the thought.

==The anxiety come from the experience==. HENCE from some physical protein in our brain. 
SO with neuroplasticity, we can change it (the tree) -> change the anxiety. 

*Exemple visuel: Pot plant look like a though with the root and the leaves.*
