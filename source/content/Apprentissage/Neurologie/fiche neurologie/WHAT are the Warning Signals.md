The four warning signals that alert us to what's going on inside us are:
- emotionally,
- behaviorally, 
- physically, 
- and in our perspective.

Those warning signal come from the **[[Division of the mind|unconscious mind]].** They always come together. 

 >**Emotion** is always link to a **behavior**. 
 >Which are link to the respond of our body (**physical**) and it's link by our **perception** of what's happening. 

##### Understanding the Warning Signals
**GOAL:**  understand where that thought come from. So I can **deconstruct** and **reconstruct** it !!

warning signal send good and bad. 
- If good, focus on it to increase resilience. 
- If bad, you work on it -*carefull, if supress it, it will grow stronger* - AS energy is never lost it just stronger. 
	- -> play with that energy. 


##### HOW warning signal manifest
Warning signals alert the conscious mind to pay attention to what is happening at the nonconscious level:
- **Emotional warning signals** 
	- are feelings of all kinds.
	- -> they are no bad emotion, these are just signal, ==don't shoot the messanger==.
	- So no matter the emotion, observe what trigger it, pain attention to the source
		- -> so you can train your resilience.
		- -> [[HOW to deal with emotion]]
- **Behavioral warning signals** 
	- are things you say and do.
- **Physical warning signals**
	- manifest the toxic energy in your body.
- **Perspective warning signals**
	- represent how you see the world.
		- AND we want to activate healthy perceptive, so we can grow resilience and improve.
	- REMEMBER: ==Whatever you [[Secret of the lake|think the most]], will keep growing.== 

###### **WHY IT MATTER ?** 
Learning to tune in to warning signals is a skill that will build self-regulation and resiliency. Hence more control over our life.
