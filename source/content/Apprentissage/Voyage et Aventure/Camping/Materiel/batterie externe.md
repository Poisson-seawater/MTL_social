###### critère:
Output Power:
- Check the output power (measured in watts or amps). For faster charging, look for power banks with at least 2.4A output per port. Some power banks support Quick Charge or Power Delivery (PD) for even faster charging.

Input Power:
- Higher input power means the power bank itself can recharge faster. Look for power banks with 2A or higher input, or those that support Quick Charge or USB-C PD input.

**Durability**:

- For camping, a rugged and durable power bank is ideal. Look for models that are water-resistant, dust-proof, and shock-proof (IP rating such as IP67 or IP68 is good).

**Additional Features**:

- **Solar Charging**: Some power banks come with built-in solar panels, which can be useful for extended trips without access to electricity.
- **Flashlight**: An integrated LED flashlight can be handy for camping.
- **Pass-through Charging**: Allows you to charge the power bank and your devices simultaneously.
