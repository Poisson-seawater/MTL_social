> They are “human-habituated” bears.


Bears have good memories. Once they figure it out, they’ll remember that human-use places provide food in fruit trees, garbage bins, vehicles and even buildings.

Human food can be irresistible to bears. Bears that are rewarded with food when they access humanuse places can become “food-conditioned.”
-> Once bears learn to associate humans and human-use places with easy, high-calorie meals, they become food-conditioned. It is difficult to prevent these bears from seeking out human food sources in the future

> Bear need 25 000 cal / day

Remember that bears are so focused on eating and protecting their young that they may not be diligent in avoiding people. 
-> Check for berry tree been destroy by bear or rock being move (they eat the insect)


###### CAMPING RULE 
Don’t bring food, toiletries or the clothes you wore when cooking or fishing into your tent. Store them in bear-resistant containers, a bear-proof locker or at least 100 meters away from where you are sleeping.

- Never abandon, bury or partially burn food scraps. Bears will be able to smell the lingering food odours. Burn scraps completely to ashes.
- Be cautious when moving around the camp at night. Carry your flashlight and bear spray and make enough noise to alert visiting wildlife of your presence.
- Use canned or dried foods—they have less odour.
- Cooking and cleaning should also be done at least 100 meters away from your tent. Wash cooking equipment immediately and dispose of dishwater 100 meters away from your campsite


##### You see a bear, so now what?
All bears are individuals, so each bear encounter will be unique. Serious attacks are rare, but you must always be BearSmart when in the wild. All bears have a “personal space” and feel threatened when this space is invaded. How they react to the threat is not always predictable and will depend on the situation at hand and the character of the individual bear. 

When you see a bear, the most important things to remember are: 
- Do not run
- Stay close to those you’re with. 
- Watch the bear and respond to what it’s doing.
- Never offer the bear food.
