Vermouth is a type of fortified wine that is made from a base of white wine that is infused with a mixture of botanicals and then fortified with a neutral spirit (usually grain or grape alcohol) to raise its alcohol level. What traditionally distinguishes vermouth from other aromatized wines (like Lillet)
is the inclusion of an herb called wormwood (from which the word “vermouth” is derived). 

Although there are many varieties, the two main ones are called “dry” and “sweet.” 
- Dry vermouths (also called white or French vermouth) have a more herbal flavor profile. 
- Sweet vermouths (also called red or Italian vermouth) tend to have more floral and spiced flavors in addition toherbs. 


> For longer shelf life, refrigerate your vermouth after opening.
