There are two main types of
cocktail shakers; the one you choose ultimately comes down to personal
preference. 



###### COBBLER SHAKER
The most common choice for home bartenders, this is an easy-to-use threepiece shaker with a bottom mixing cup, a built-in strainer on top, and a cap to seal it. Metal and plastic components will be less likely than glass to break.

##### BOSTON SHAKER
The choice of bartenders everywhere, this is what we used to develop our recipes. It consists of a bottom stainless steel cup and a top cup that looks like a pint glass but is made of tempered (safety) glass. The glass allows you to see your ingredients as you add them, which bartenders prefer to help prevent error.
