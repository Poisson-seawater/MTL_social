Simple Syrup refers to a 1-to-1 mixture of sugar and water. It is an essential
ingredient in cocktails.



**Grenadine** is a flavored syrup made using pomegranate juice, though many
commercial brands use artificial flavor.


**Orgeat** is a syrup traditionally made from almonds and frequently flavored
with orange blossom water. It is indispensable to tiki cocktails, including the
[[Mai Tai]] and [[Scorpion Cup]].


**Shrub syrups** are sweetened fruit-and-vinegar syrups that are frequently used in cocktails. They also make great
nonalcoholic cocktails when mixed with seltzer.
