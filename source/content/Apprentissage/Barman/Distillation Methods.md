###### **Distillation Methods**
1. **Pot Stills**
    - **Process**: Batch distillation using a pot-shaped still.
    - **Flavor**: Produces richer, more flavorful distillates due to higher congeners (compounds responsible for aroma and taste).
2. **Column Stills**
    - **Process**: Continuous distillation in a column structure.
    - **Flavor**: Produces purer, higher-proof spirits with fewer congeners, resulting in a more neutral flavor.

Climate plays a significant role in how rum ages, with tropical climates accelerating the process.
