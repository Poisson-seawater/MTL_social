### Tropical drinks

The tropical-drink craze was started in America by Donn the Beach- comber (real name: Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt), who opened a tiki-themed joint in Hollywood in 1934. "Trader" Vic Bergeron took the concept and ran with it, evidently granting bartenders nationwide permission to throw together lots of fruit juices and three or four dif- ferent rums, give the resultant drink an exotic name, and consider it a masterpiece. I wonder if he knew what kind of devil he was unleash- ing onto civilized society.
That said, some tropical drinks can be wonderfully refreshing-the Piña Colada, for instance, is a personal favorite-and some of these potions are made from well-thought-out formulas. It's important that the cock- tailian bartender know how to make the most popular of these drinks, so I have included recipes for those drinks that should be preserved.

### Sours

Definition: Sours contain a base liquor, lime or lemon juice, and a non- alcoholic sweetening agent, such as simple syrup, grenadine, or pineap- ple juice. If the base of a sour is a liqueur, no additional sweetening agent is required.


#### Sours: international sours

Definition: International Sours call for a base liquor and either lime or lemon juice, and are sweetened by a liqueur, another fruit juice, or both.

#### sours: new Orleans sours

Definition: New Orleans Sours call for a base spirit, lemon or lime juice, and triple sec or another orange-flavored liqueur, such as
curaçao.

#### sours: sparkling  sours

Definition: Sparkling Sours contain a base spirit, lemon or lime juice, sweetening agent, and a carbonated beverage.

Although Sparkling Sours call for lemon or lime juice, these drinks can instead be made by muddling citrus wedges with granulated sugar, skipping the simple syrup called for in the formula; when the sugar abrades the zest of the fruit, it will release the oils from the zest. Since these drinks are usually served in collins glasses, the muddling can be done in the glass, but I prefer to muddle the fruit and sugar in a mixing glass, add all the ingredients except for the carbonated beverage, and then strain the mixture into an ice-filled collins glass before adding the soda.

#### Squirrel sours
Call for a base spirit, lemon or lime juice, and crème de noyau or another nut-flavor liqueur. 

### Snappers
Definition: Snappers are mixed drinks made with savory ingredients such as tomato juice, beef bouillon, and clam juice and seasoned with a variety of condiments.

### Punches

Definition: Punches are mixed drinks made in large quantities for parties and other social gatherings.


Punches make life easy for the host at large parties and even small gatherings. The drink is made beforehand, and guests enjoy the ritual of helping themselves whenever they are ready for a second or third drink. It's best to keep punches cold by using large blocks of ice in the bottom of the bowl; these are easily achieved by using thoroughly washed juice or milk cartons, which can be peeled away from the ice without a great deal of effort.
Although water is a necessary ingredient in the vast majority of cocktails, Punches usually contain enough water in the form of fruit juices, or low-alcohol beverages such as wine, to be at their best when first made. Therefore, I recommend that Punches be chilled in the fridge prior to service, helping them stay true to their flavors for a


### Pousse-cafés

Definition: Pousse-Cafés are drinks made by floating one ingredient on
top of another, or several others, to create a multilayered effect.

Pousse-café literally translates as "push the coffee," although the intent is unclear. Did this category of drinks originate as something to "push" the coffee down your throat? Or perhaps, as some people have sug- gested, the phrase might have originally meant "Push the coffee away, I'll have myself a drink."
Pousse-Cafés are layered drinks (see page 91), and can be quite beau- tiful, but although some people love making them, others don't think it's worth the time and effort. I normally stand alongside the latter, but drinks like the AWOL have at times persuaded me to join the former group.

### Orphans
33 drinks that do not fit in any other family. 


### Muddle drinks
Definition: Muddled drinks are made by crushing some of the in- gredients with a wooden muddler, or pestle, before adding ice and spirits.


When granulated sugar is muddled with wedges of citrus fruit (see page 90), it can add an extra dimension to some otherwise ordinary potions. The recipe for the Tom Collins, for instance, calls for lemon juice-it's basically no more than gin, lemonade, and club soda, and it's a very refreshing drink. But if, instead of making the Tom Collins with lemon juice squeezed from the fruit, you muddle lemon wedges with granulated sugar, you'll find that the sugar extracts the essential oils from the lemon zest and adds an extra sparkle to the drink. This doesn't happen in every muddled drink; nevertheless, the act of muddling is part of the show for the customer, and it should be performed where you, the bartender, can easily be seen.


### Milanese drink

This is a small but very important family of drinks, all of which call for Campari. Campari is a form of bitters first produced in Milan, circa 1867, by Gaspare Campari, owner of the Café-Patisserie Campari; it's said that you must try this drink three times before you'll enjoy it.

### Juleps
Although the word julep has no true connection to mint, we have come to instantly think of that fragrant herb whenever the word is spoken. The drinks in this family, therefore, all depend on fresh mint as a fla- voring agent, or simply as an aromatic garnish.


### Jelly shot
Shot in drink that have gelatinized due to addition of gelatin (unflavor).



### Infusion


### Hot drink

Most hot drinks are fairly simple to prepare, but some, such as Café Brûlot, require a little skill. Remember, though, when making hot drinks in which spices are called for, to use the freshest ingredients possible in order to extract more flavor. 

For hot drinks served with cream floating on top, please avoid the use of artificial products.

### Highball


Definition: Highballs are built in highball glasses; they call for a base
spirit and a mixer, such as soda or water.

###### Origine of the name
Highball is a railroad term formerly used to indicate to the conductor on a steam train that there was enough water in the tank, and thus the train could go full speed ahead. The water level was indi- cated by a ball connected to a float inside the tank, so when the ball was high, the tank was full. In a television documentary that aired in 1999, a guy who'd ridden the rails during the Depression said that when a train was about to leave, "they gave you the highball-that's two shorts [whistle blows] and a long. Man, you better be ready then 'cause he's pulling out." This appeals to me, since the whistle signal could be perverted to mean two shots of liquor and a long drink, such as ginger ale; but why Duffy chose the name, we'll probably never know.


#### Florida Highball
Florida Highballs are mixed drinks built in a highball glass that contain orange or grapefruit juice **but not cranberry juice** (it's in New England Highballs). 

#### New England Highball
All New England Highballs contain cranberry juice and are built in a highball glass. Although there are only six drinks in the New England Highball family, it's interesting to note the relationship between the Cape Codder, the Madras, Sex on the Beach, and the Woo Woo.

### Frozen drink
Made with electrical blender and should be easily drink with a strow. 


### French-Italian drink

Definition: French-Italian drinks contain a distilled spirit and sweet or dry vermouth, or sometimes both. They can be modified by other ingredients.

### Duo or Trio
Definition: Duos are composed of two ingredients, usually a base spirit and a liqueur, and are normally served in an old-fashioned glass. Trios are Duos to which cream or a cream liqueur has been added. Not all Duos can be made into Trios. Not all Trios start out as Duos.

### Cobbler
Adding suggar to a glass with crushed ice and decorate with fruit. With a base liquor and a sweeting agent. 

### champagne cocktail
original is a sugar cube with bitter on it.


### bottle cocktail
Water is an ingredient to compensate for the ice melting from the shaker or miking glass.
Useful for hosting party. 


## généralité
##### Get own way of crafting cocktail
Get your own way of doing stuff, mixing, stirring, shaking, taking bottle ... SO you create a kind of artistic vibe. 

- [ ] quand une job de barman ALORS recheck ordre de mes notes et ajouter les info du livre "The joy of mixiologie" dans les [[verre]], les accessoirs, ingredients ....
##### Barman attitude
Le barman représente le patron en son absence. 
Si un client n'était pas là, il n'était pas là. 

Pensé a écouter discrètement les conversations et regarder le non verbal pour s'assurer que tout les clients ont du bon temps !

SI un client veut offrir un verre a un autre, il est de politesse de demander se le receveur veux accepter ce verre. 

Faire d'eye contact avec un client seulement quand prêt a recevoir sa commande OU pour lui dire je t'ai vu et j'arrive bientôt. 



###### Payement cash
Always say out loud how much monaie you receive and the total price.
SO if client disagree, you can talk  !



###### how to arrange liquor bottle
Label should point toward the customer and all pourers should face the left side of the label from the customer standpoint.
