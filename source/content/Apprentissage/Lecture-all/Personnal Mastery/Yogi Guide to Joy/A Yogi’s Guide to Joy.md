# The sources of all Suffering

###### Half Alive concept
Being half-alive is torture, just like the frog being disect in Biology. Half alive people 
- suffer everthing.
	- you are suffering mariage and not being in a mariage
	- suffering poverty and money
	- suffering loneliness and company
- need pleasure to "feel alive"
	- need distraction, dopamine ...
And thet try to be alive with money, sex, drog ... which ended up just giving them more suffer. 
SO Pleasure become the most important for half-alive people.

When become fully alive, the though of pleasure evaporate.
Because you become estatic without reason, become blissfull. You don't look for the drink anymore.

###### Escape by: respond
Ability to respond mean the people respond; as a dead person doesn't respond.
SO sign of aliveness is from the ability to respond. 
death is relief while full aliveness is fantastic.

You become half alive by always calculating what to respond to

What is confortable, they are responsable, What is not confortable they are not responsable -> this process make people half alive. 
Because it make you always calculate what to respond to and not respond to.
BUT, for alive people, your ability to respond should be unbridled, unlimited in order to stay fully alive. 

When you are not responsable for what is not confortable in your life, you become half-alive. 

By calibrating ability to respond, it create becoming Half-Alive. Hence, your ability to respond should be unbridled, unlimited in order to stay fully alive. 

Ability to respond in physical life is limited, where ability to respond in life is limitless. 


# Resisting Change is Resisting Life
When we resist change, we create unnecessary suffering and we are resisting life. It is important to let go of all that is holding you back.
Cause:
1. The essence of physical existence is “change”.
2. If you are resisting change you are resisting life and creating unnecessary suffering.

Ask yourself, “What can I do in order to relax, dissolve, and release this resistance?”.
-> accept everything as they are. No etiquette, no judgement nor calculation. 

Ex: being disturbe by going out of confort zone.


Depression and frustration is an non-good way to kill oneself. Both are the best "devil-tool" cause they make you work against yourself.


## Complementary Video - How Do We Move Into a State of Being Able to Accept and Move With Change?
1. The word **kālá**, is the traditional Hindu unit of time, which also relates to the "cyclical", emptiness and space.
2. The fundamental fabric of life is [time] and that's always moving.
3. When you flow with the above, you can accept and move with change. 

All of us is an accumalation, an accumulation of thought and food. But accumulation can only **own** not be **oneself**. 
If you take a distance between you and your body, you will realize it's not you

Just like flat vs round Earth: All need is taking Distance, just like the flat or round Earth; it just need to go to the Moon to see Earth is round. 


Body and mind is accumulation over time, everything that is accumulation of the time can be a **own** but can't be **oneself**. 
So learn to master thought, just like you master using hand. See yourself from the distance, just like you see your hand from afart.
Another way to think about Distance is actors. They put a clothes, when they took it off, all the drama from their caractere goes aways. 


###### TIME:
in Yoga they don't see time and space. They just see Time and Time. This "Time" is call Kala, it mean time, emptiness or space. 

Point A and point B are separate by time. It's the most fundamental aspect of life

As we can't bring back yesterday. Even if it was there !!
SO the fabric concept of life: Time; Is always moving.
Like the clock is always moving and if the clock isn't then it's day => we are always moving. 
-> every aspect of life is dynamic. If it static it mean it's dead. 

# The end of Suffering
When you gain mastery over your life energies your destiny will be 100% in your control and suffering disappears. 

Tool to be “above the intellectual process” of the mind and will make suffering be finished in your life.

We are capable of suffering anything: social, loneliness, love, sickness ...
If had mastery over life energies, what would you instruct your life energies to be misery or joy?
Sufery is in control, it's imaginary. 

We have been train by people, that may not be professional, like family, relative ... .
This training, create our "software".


Once you are above the intellectual process, suffering is finish in your life. *Buddha means above intellect*.

Animal just suffer physical word, vs Human that suffer anything (cause are in Intellectual). 
And Human go into drunk or other pleasure to quit the intellect.
Have to evolve above the intelect. 

## Above the intellect
The first step toward moving from the trap of the intellect to the lap of a larger intelligence is to recognize that every aspect of life is a manifestation of a far greater intelligence than our minuscule intellect.

1. Take a step and start recognizing every day, all the things you see are a manifestation of a greater intelligence.
2. Pay attention to how life starts speaking to you.

Remove from the mind the idea that tought is intelligent. 

## How Are We Making Ourselves Suffer?
1. We generally speak that suffering is physical and mental but physically we can only have pain.
	1. pain is a mecanism of survivable, a safety. It's is necesarry
2. Suffering is manufactured in your mind as a reaction to what happens in your body or around you.
	1. suffering is how we react to situation to our environment, our reaction (suffering) is only our
3. The kind of thoughts and emotions you generate is 100% yours.

# Live a Life without Fear

Most humans never walk full stride, but take only half-steps due to the fear of suffering. To you live a life with endless possibilities, goal is
- is inner management AND
- how to handle your thoughts and emotions, 

BUT you don't need to control all even that happen to you. 
All you need is to ensure you are you: that you doesnt lose yourself, that your keep you [character] (Marc Aurèle), that you manage yourself.
*if you are well manage, why does it matter if you walk through Hell. You have Paradise in yourself.*
-> So ill manage people want to stay in confort zone. 
AND ill manage people will do limited think. Fearing action. 
BUT every being should try to do the best out of life. 
SO ill manage people become sad and suffer by being static. 

1. When we say, “I'm only human”, we are not talking about the possibilities of being a human, but limitations.
	1. We are the most capable and intelligent species on this planet. 
	2. Hence, “Should we actually be talking about our possibilities or limitations?".
2. Managing your thoughts and emotions leads to a life without fear.
	1. keep paradise in yourself.

If try to control everyting, you will fail. But if you are well manage in thought, energy and emotion; you controle yourself. Hence it doesnt matter where you are.
Should be learn by 10 year old. 


# Suffering or Joy – You Choose
Outside situations will never happen 100% the way you want them, but what happens within you must happen the way you want. 

Suffering is a choice, and one must find what truly matters to him in order to focus on it.

>  Well-being and the entire human experience come from within.

We have the most complexe machine in the planete, but we haven't learn the user manual. 

All happen within oneself. We see the reflexion of light, we ear the what goes into our ear. And all those stimulis are treated by our brain. 

### Inner Reflection
all our material achievement come from the fact that we have it, and other don't have it -> rarety. It's ind of unhealty way of taking joy from achievement. 

1. Sit alone for **five minutes** and see what your life would be like if you were absolutely alone in this world.
2. Reflect,
	- If there were nobody or nothing to compare yourself with, what would you truly long for?
	- What would really matter to you if there were no external appreciation or critique?

# You don't need to manage stress
1. Stress happens because of our inability to manage our own system.
2. It's not stress you need to manage: it's your mind.
	1. Write down the things that you need to manage in your mind before thinking about “managing stress”.
	2. Think about positive habits that can help you improve managing the above.

Have to act at an easy pace, with the least amout of friction (<=> stress).


## How Do We Manage Our System, so Stress Is Less?
1. Stress is not part of your life. 
	1. it's just in our mind.
2. It happens because we haven't figured out how to handle our own thought, energy and emotion.
3. When you learn how to produce the right kind of chemistry in your thoughts and emotions, you will be blissful.
	1. metaphore: we have a big chemestry factory. Sayong that stress is not in our life or outside naturally. It mean we are a bad CEO, cause we are responsable for the stress our factory made. 
4. Have more Attention !!!


We manage think that we want and like family, friend ... Why you need to manage stress ??


Stress is the path to sucide.

# Step Out of the Psychological Game
Sometimes we trap ourselves in our own psychological drama of thoughts and emotions. 
- This drama is like a cloud blocking the sun – it prevents us from experiencing life the way it is.
- "Psychological drama” is an accumulation of the wrong thoughts and emotions. 
	- -> it have nothing to do with the reality

Removing these accumulations leads to joy and peace.


1. The type of information you’ve gathered determines the type of thought and emotion that you have.
2. Whatever you accumulate can never ever be you.
3. That you are **alive** right now, is the most important thing in your life.

> Ask yourself and write down your insights in your journal: 
> - “What are the things I have accumulated that can never be me?”.


> Thought are not ME, they come from information we gather. 
> AS what we accumulate can be own, but never ever be ME.

everything in the cosmos is doing great but one bad thought and it's a bad day??

## Chemistry of Peace
Be peacefull to enjoy every aspect of life. 

Do not make a natural aspect of your life into someting esoteric.
Creating a chemistry of peacefullness is your responsability. 

> Remind yourself, for at least 5 minutes every day, that what you accumulate, all we accumulate from learning to object can be ours, but never ever be ME.

Guide yourself to feel a deep sense of involvement in everything you do.


# Relationships & Emotions
When we let go of expectations with ourselves and others we can experience relationships joyfully. 

1. When you let go of expectations with yourself and others you can experience relationships joyfully.
2. The entire body is a certain [[integrity]] of memory. 
	1. When you consciously keep your body's memory at its minimum, you can choose a partner from a place of consciousness and not compulsiveness.
3. Keeping yourself pleasant is 100% your responsibility and nobody else's.


Which way to run is the nicer, because a dog chassing you or because you train your leg and lumg for it. So it's about the experience of running, make it a good experience. 


If you love someone, then people you love should do what bring joy to them. And if you are hurt by they action, you should ask yourself why you prison this love one into YOUR expectatio. 
We should ask, when complaining about a love one attitude:
- are they doing something that is not beneficiary for them or for me ??
	- if they are damaging their life you can intervene, BUT you have to own the right to inervene.



Concept of Runanubandha: idea of keeping physical memory to the minimum
- cause whatever we do, we create a memory, in us and into our environment
	- *like some people in India refuse Handshake cause they don't wont to create a memory of you in their body*
		- *like a dog can smell you had sit somewhere, they refuse to have your energy*
	- it's to keep your "memory integrity"
- idea of "integrity": here integrity is the holding of yourself.
	- *if you eat dog food and behave like a dog, you won't transform into a dog physically. Because of Integrity.*
	- *or like people that always come to sit to the exact same place*
- ease go away with excess of memory
	- hence, feel pleasure but not joy (joy x time = happiness)

Applying integrity in romantic life. When a child of 4y and half, we are attach to the mother. The child integrity = the mother integrity. Then the child "felt off" his mother integrity. And at this point, he need to learn to master his integrity. If not, the problem that will rise is that the adolescent and adulte will have the urge to attach himself to someone else. Instead of becoming trully himself...

for knowledge, in India a full life is consider 1008 cycle of the moon. Also cycle of woman being close to cycle of the moon, we become close to the moon. And it mean people in 84y have live a full live. 

Regarding forgiveness; 
- anger, resentment and all are poison for ourself.
- So why whould I think that drinking poison whould make the other one die ??


Reflect on 2 of your closest relationships and see what unrealistic expectations you have that could be straining them.
- See in which way you can make these relationships more pleasant.


## Yoga of Namaskar
Loving attention:
1. Put your hands together in alignment with each other at the level of your heart.
2. Look upon someone or something that means much to you.
	1. hold love
3. In an attitude of loving attention, hold Namaskar for 3 to 5 minutes every day. 


# Do You Listen to Your Head or Your Heart
The way you think is the way you emote.
- like  *I think she is the most wonderfull person on the planete -> emotion become sweet.*
Also, when we speak multiple language, sometime we mixte them. It's the same with the heart and thougth.
Thought are agile while emotion is a little sappy. It's why when we switch thought our emotion may take some time to switch too. 
Head and Heart say the same thing, just there is some delay. SO before you make big decisions in life, withdraw from the pressure of other people

Difference between making decisions from your head and your heart, such as the importance of withdrawing from external pressure when making decision.
BECAUSE, you must think clearly. 
-> spend a time by yourself for example


ALSO: you should not do something you would be ashame of in the long run. 


Story of the girl and the scientific; you never stop learning in life. Just like when the girl ask the scientific what he do, and answer: "I'm studying Science."
In life it's the same, we never stop learning about us and life. About our heart and brain; unlike a profesionnal sportman who may have nothing more to learn in terme of moving his body. 



HOW to practice it: 
1. Reflect on the outcomes you have, 
	1. when you only make decisions from your head OR your heart.       
2. Write down the most important decision you need to make in your life right now. 

###### HOW to make decision
1. Think about how you can withdraw from external influences and pressure before taking this decision
	1. identify the external pressure your peers or others may be exerting on you with regards to this decision and see how to distance yourself from this when making the decision
2. Evaluate what this would mean to you 3 years later, or 5 years later, and 10 years later.
3. Just see what this decision really means to you as a person, what you really want to do?

you should not do something you would be ashame of in the long run. 

# The Fundamental Nature of Yoga
Once balance happens, it is possible to create many things upon this stable foundation.
1. “Karma” means your experience of your life is entirely your making.
	1. If someting not working for you, look at what you are doing is wrong
2. Bringing balance to the system is the fundamental nature of Yoga.


for many people, brain is being a "nuisage" so those person need to drink or sleep. 
It's a joke cause our brain is the biggest evolution of human. 

You need to find balance into yoursef. It just need to do the basic right. 
1. all human experience is generate from within. 
	1. you can create stimuly or take external stimuly
	2. so something is always wrong from you and never from the outside. 
2. balance to yourself is the most basic idea of Yoga
	1. then after the balance, you can build 
3. it's the concept of Karma, all your life is from your making
	1. it's your action, it's about paradise in your heart when you travel trought hell.


ACTION: reflext about nature of "Yoga"

# Unshakeable Stability
In a way, spiritual progress is to become like a mountain: stable, still.
Cause when you have a stable base, many think can arrive. 

Stability is both an absolute calm AND an exhuberant dance.
It's about seeing better life, your body...
The moment you identify with something your entire mind understands it needs to be protected.
- Everything is just an amplification of your identification with the limited boudaries of your body
	- with that way of processus, drama just keep amplifying. 
	- Thought mean something that is not real
		- and thought can only come from past data. 
- Stability come down to the distance between you and your body, to your ability to see better
- When we get rid of the identifications within the limited boundaries of our mind and body, exuberance and stability will naturally happen.


Stability is an absolute necessity to live playfully without crashing.
- Find out how to establish stability, 
- why it has nothing to do with control but clarity, 
	- and how identifications are just obstacles in the way of enjoying life with joy and exuberance.


# Living With Freedom
Human beings have the freedom to make themselves whichever way they want. Unfortunately, most of humanity is suffering from this “freedom”.


1. Freedom is a territory where you have to culture and mature yourself to exist free.
2. To be free is 100% one's business <=> understanding that keeping in a pleasant state
	1. body, 
	2. emotions and 
	3. energy  


We where monkey, then nature make us evolve into human. However we still have to consciously evolve.
Being human is not an establish state, you can be God-like then an asshole. Just like human is the line between monkey and surhuman. So we are not a fixe state, we have the freedom to do what we want. 
If life is fixe, we don't have stress cause we don't have the freedom to choose what to be. 
- A tiger doesn't worry to be a good tiger, 
	- he just need to get food 
	- and not becoming a house cat to be a good tiger. 
- It's a fixed state. 
- While the human is not a fixed state. Human is a possibility. 


Bad freedom can be compulsive. *like someone saying: "I'm not free to drink today?"*
Freedom is a territory where you have to culture and mature yourself to exist free.
- try just doing minimum: drinking and food and learn about yourself.

If body become pleasant, we call it Health, if it become very pleasant we call it pleasure.
If mind become pleasant, we call it Peace, if it become very pleasant we call it Joy.
If emotion become pleasant, we call it Love, if it become very pleasant we call it Compassion.
If your very life energies become pleasant we call it Blissfulness and if it become very pleasant we call it Extasy. 
If your surending become pleasant, we call it success. AND only for this one, we need the cooperation of many force around us. 

Your life is an expression of your bliss. So do what you need. In pursuit of hapiness, we have destroy the planet. Happiness is from within.

Take charge of yourself, give instruction to your:
1. body
2. mind 
3. emotion
4. and energy

> always master at 100% the paradise inside your heart.

you first need to do something with yourself, otherwise you will not end up the way you want it to be. 

# Your Inner Peace is Achievable - Here's Why
Determine the nature of your experience.
Be in charge of what create experience within you.


When you determine ways to discover your true nature you will naturally create pleasantness for yourself and others.  

1. Whatever is the nature of your experience happens within you.
2. If you can determine the nature of your experience, you become in control of your peacefulness, happiness and blissfulness.
3. If you are feeling very pleasant within yourself, you will naturally be pleasant with everybody else around you.

Grace is like the lubriquant of a machinerie. 
If a machine have no lubriquant, the machine broke in 10min.
Grace is the lubriquant for the friction of life.

### Exercice
1. Ask yourself, 
	- “What are the moments where I feel more pleasant within myself?”
	- “What can I do to sustain these moments?”

## Nadi Shuddhi
The Nadi Shuddhi practice cleanses the “Nadis”, meaning the pathways through which pranic energy flows resulting in a balanced system and psychological wellbeing.

# Being Playful Is the Most Responsible Thing You Can Do
Playfulness has been wrongly equated with irresponsibility. Instead of walking around with a long face, entangled with your own creation, if you are playful with life and in tune with the larger creation, it is the most responsible way to live.

1. Being **playful** really means being responsible and responsive to life. 
2. If you are in tune with the creation and the creator, being playful becomes very natural.
3. When you burn up everything that is “You”, what you are really devoted or passionate about will flourish.


It's irresponsable to walk with a stick in the ass or with misery. Cause in this state, you don't pay attention to anything.

While only way playfull, you are really attentif to life. 
You pay attention to your surending and yourself
- creation is god play
- playfullness is the attitude of creation; it need to be in tine with the creation and creator.
- when you play you are not affect by the game itself. You distance yourself from it. 
- being playfull is about being in Yoga state - harmony state. 
- make every activity playfull


Burn everything that is you, 
- the idea of choosing the path of passion is that you want to burn up everythinh that is you.
- you have to burn to let new possibility arrise.


## Nada Yoga
**Nada Yoga** “the yoga of sound or reverberation”, allows you to utter the sounds that create an inner atmosphere of joy, making it a natural way to be. Watch this video and follow along with the instructions whenever you practice “Nada Yoga”.

1. **Aaa**, **Ooo** and **Mmm**, are the 3 fundamental sounds of existence.
	1. call universal sound
2. Uttering them activates the 3 basic segments of your body: **Upper**, **middle** and **lower**.

# Life Ticks Away
Life is constantly ticking away but that means it’s time to smile, not frown! If you can be 100% alive every moment, then you can live joyfully and exuberantly by your own nature.
- Every time you check a watch or a clock, give yourself a smile and express gratitude for being alive.


THE most important thing in our life is **that we are alive.** Because we are alive, family, friend, country ... become important too.
- so give yourself a big smile every time you are alive !!!
	- "your life is thinking aways, not the clock"
- so many people walk in the stress as if they are posing for there grave
	- people live inefficiantly but nobody died inefficiently
	- so just be in Harmony and playfullness state.

If you think about mortality, it make you depress. And if you live with every moment, it will make you absolutly exuberant and alive. 
- if you want to stretch your life -> you just have to be miserable all the time
	- BUT if you are always in extatic state, life will feel really short -> so be gratefull !!

You don't teach a mango tree to be sweet it does it naturally. But you have to teach a miserable human to become alive and loving. 
CCL if you are exuberantly alive, it is natural for human consciousness to bleed sweetness. 

Final tips:
Only if you are joyfull by your own nature that is "you have no fear of suffering". 
Only when you have no fear of suffering, will you dare to walk you life full stride.

THEN we can do what we can do. Everytingh that you can do, could happen, especially if it help the all.


## Tips for Love
For 5 minutes every day, go sit with something that does not mean anything to you. (Maybe a tree, a pebble, or an insect).


Love is on self-start, just like blissfullness or extasy. Because they are all from our chemistry.
