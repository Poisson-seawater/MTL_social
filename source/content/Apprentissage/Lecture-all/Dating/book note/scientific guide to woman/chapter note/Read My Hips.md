GOAL of the chapter: Understanding Women and Attraction


##### Mad Skills
Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills. Need to have expertize; Women are attracted to men who are the CEO and president of. . . themselves.
We are talking about Confidance (not arrogance).

Confidence comes from being secure in your abilities. Arrogance actually comes from being insecure in your abilities.

Woman will subconsciously send "you can talk to me" signal to men she value; way before you start talking to her.
The first cue woman is looking for is symetrie. 


##### Take Up Space
The first behavior that will make a woman pay attention is what scientists call “space maximizing.” Think about it: The person who takes up the most space is considered the socially dominant person.
-> own the space you occupied.


"Good glancing behaviors.” Looked a women in the eyes and often accompaned it with a smile.

DO Intragender touching - you slapping your buddy on the back or throwing an arm around his shoulders, mano a mano. This signals social dominance and will make you more likely to get the go-ahead signal from a woman.

BE low stress vibe -> atractive to woman, show cold blood -> reliable.

NO
- “closed-body movements”— like hugging yourself. 
- fidgets or crazy, random nervous gestures with your hands, -> appear less confident, less socially dominant, and therefore less desirable to women

##### You Know She’s Interested When . . .
Women will: tilt their heads, give a particular
man short glances, dart their eyes if he looks, run their fingers through their hair, lick
their lips, and expose their necks, showed their palms to the man, hiked up their skirts a bit, revealed more of their legs, turned in their seats, or caressed an object, sometimes in suggestive, even sensual ways.  Walked across the room, swaying their hips, and brushed by a man, touching him  leetingly with their thighs or breasts. 

The most common is direct eye contact. A smile. Repeatedly glancing at you and away from you. 

IF see those -> go talk to her. 


##### A Word of Caution
Woman will show YES and NO. NO sign are: 
If you approach a woman and she continues to talk to her friend, she’s not interested.
If she won’t make eye contact with you while politely engaging in small talk or she is looking over your head and scanning the room. Yawns or leans or turns away.
-> you need to move on.

IF she is shy AND interest -> she want do eye contact. Instead: she may show other signs of social anxiety, such as stuttering when she speaks to you or saying “ummm” a lot while speaking. But she will engage in conversation

Women find funny men more attractive, because humor is an indicator of intelligence. Women don’t like meekness in a man, either, because meekness makes men seem less confident and less ambitious, and therefore weaker from an evolutionary perspective.


> Remember to look into her eyes, smile, stand up straight (posture indicates confidence), and don’t fidget.

#### Recap
Women are attracted to confidence and high status. Become the best “you” possible and
exhibit the nonverbal behaviors that indicate social dominance, such as space
maximization, male-to-male touching, relaxation, and looking into her eyes and smiling.
Avoid fidgeting, poor posture, folding your arms across your chest, or crossing your legs
at the knee.
Women control whether men approach them by exhibiting a series of nonverbal cues
and indicators. Learn the signs that indicate she’s interested.
She repeatedly glances at you and looks away.
She leans toward you while talking.
She points in your direction with her leg, foot, or shoulders.
She plays with or tosses her hair.
She fidgets with a piece of jewelry (like an earring) or strokes the stem of her glass.


YOU MIGHT BE A ZERO IF. . .
You ignore the signs that she is not attracted to you and pursue her anyway. Signals of
disinterest include:
She doesn’t make eye contact (unless she’s shy).
She yawns repeatedly when you talk to her.
She leans or turns her body away from you.
She looks over your head or scans the room.
She tells you she’s not interested in you.
Additionally, you are not helping your cause if:
You think hygiene and clothing don’t matter.
You think drunkenness is attractive.
You don’t make eye contact or smile at a woman you’re interested in.
Your posture or demeanor indicates weakness or you otherwise look like someone who can’t keep her
safe.
You can’t differentiate between confidence and arrogance. One is attractive to women; the other is
not.
