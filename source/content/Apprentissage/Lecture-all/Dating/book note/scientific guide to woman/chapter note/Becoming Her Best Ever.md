GOAL: A Primer on Passionate Sex

> The real lover is the man who can thrill you just by touching your head or smiling into your eyes—or just by staring into space.

Every woman is different. When it comes to making love, some women like things slow and gentle. Some women like things fast and hard. And most women want different things at different times in their day, or cycle, or stage of life.

Porc-épic, le mâle pour éviter de se faire empaler doit prendre le temps de caresser la femelle jusqu'a qu'elle baisse ses épines. 
=> remember arousal start way before the bedroom !!

Don’t take it personally if she says no. Say something like, “Baby, you just look so beautiful tonight. Maybe we can find another time when you’re feeling more rested.” Or, even better, “Thanks for telling me you’re not in the mood for sex. What are you in the mood for? Would you like to take a walk, or make popcorn and watch a movie, or just talk, or cuddle?”


##### Personal Sex
There is sex and sex; the mind blowing one and the masturbation like. 
The secret to turning physiological interest into actual desire for sex is to connect the mind, the heart, and the genitals. In other words, it’s not just about what you do, but also how you do it.

##### The Art and Science of Lovemaking
Note: average masturbation time is the same for both sex. 

While a woman is turned on by how a man looks, she is even more turned on by how he
speaks, how he acts, how he treats her, how he touches her.
Sex for women is a story. Remember that you are writing a story in her mind
about her, about you, and about your building passion. The takeaway: Think about sex as
something that starts with the way you hold her hand or kiss her lips or even open the
door for her.
Long before you fall into bed together, you can be creating anticipation.
You can text, suggest, flirt, and create a sense of possibility and inevitability.

> ==Build Anticipation==: Dopamine
>  -> Dopamine gives you the sense that something wonderful is about to happen.

That is the craving. The more aroused she is, the
higher her dopamine, and the higher her dopamine, the more she craves something—in
this case, you. This is why anticipation is so important. It creates the desire to seek in
the brain. Think about how fun it was to play hide-and-seek as a child. We’re not
suggesting that you play children’s games here—just keep your partner anticipating
your next text or touch or kiss. Novelty also spikes dopamine, so the more you keep
things interesting and avoid pushing the familiar buttons, the better. Dopamine is about
wanting and desire, and you want her to want you.

=> remember, create anticipation during all the sex !!! That mean go slowly, take your time and play with rythm. Tease her. Tempt her.

###### Her Voluptuous Soul
For mind blowing sex: look into her eye an smile (a real one, saying she is the best).
The only way to generate a real smile in these circumstances is to think about the affection and appreciation you feel for your partner.

###### Puckering Up
> rule: everything you do positive for her is foreplay

###### Your Touch Is Electric
Sensual touch is often light and suggestive, tantalizing the skin.

###### Other
entering from behind, your penis will be angled down against the front wall of her vagina and can stimulate her A-spot.

The period after sex is a source of enormous pleasure for women. They often want to be held, stroked, cuddled, to continue to feel close and caressing her skin. Yes, you may want to pass out and go to sleep, and that’s fine. Put your arm
around her. There’s nothing you have to do but make her feel safe and loved than to be hold -> HOLD her all the time !!


#### Recap
Forget everything you ever learned from watching porn.

Long before you get into bed together, you can begin to make love to your partner by building anticipation and creating a sense of possibility and inevitability. Text, flirt, suggest, and build passion before you even touch.
- Every time you are sexual, you tell a story about who you are, who she is, and who you can be
together. Make the story amazing.

Most men have a pretty familiar routine—kiss the lips, touch the breasts, touch the clitoris (maybe) or
vagina, and insert the penis. A skillful lover doesn’t follow any set routine. You can make love to every
inch of her with your words, lips, tongue, and hands. 
- Don’t just focus on her breasts and genitals.
- Oral sex is a must for pleasing and satisfying a woman. If you don’t like it—get over it.
- Most women need clitoral stimulation to have an orgasm. Become best buddies with her clitoris.

Keep making love to a woman by holding her after the sex is over. This is a great source of pleasure for women. Making this one last heroic effort (even when you want to go to sleep) will go a long way toward making you her best ever.
