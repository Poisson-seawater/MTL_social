If you have enterd into a serious relationship with a woman, the truth is, you’ve also entered into a relationship with her friends. 

Woman needs social support from other women.
Period. No matter how much you can attune. 

A study on breast cancer show that a woman with breast cancer was more likely to survive if she have 10 or more good friend (girl). Amazingly, it’s the opposite for men. Men need a woman to stay alive.
-> whether men would die younger was whether or not they were married, whereas for women it was their friendships with other women that determined their longevity.


##### woman friend 
If you find yourself feeling jealous of the time your partner spends with her friends,
share your feelings with her. Tell her that you miss her and want to spend more time
with her. Don’t get angry about it. Most women understand connecting, and if you let her know you need to connect more, she will understand. People have an unlimited
capacity to love. She can love you and love her friends


##### Male Friends (for woman)
Men and women can be friends, and they can even be close friends and a source of support for one another.
One of the ways that friendships slip into affairs is when a woman starts complaining to her male friends about her relationship. Ask her for reassurance when you need it, and ask her to please not discuss with her male friend any problems that may come up in your relationship, and instead to come to you directly.
