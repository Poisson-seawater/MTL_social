###### The One Thing All Women Look for in a Man
trustworthiness.

trustworthiness is: You are who you say you are and you do what you say you are going to do. It’s about reliability, accountability, and showing up just as you are (but with good hygiene). -> to understand from evolutionary stand point.
Got to do the little gesture that show you care. 


###### The Two Major Complaints That Women Have
They are:
- He is never there for me.” T
- “There isn’t enough intimacy and connection.”

Most of the time, this is about 
- being there for them emotionally:
	- listening to them, 
	- caring for them, 
	- and **safeguarding their hearts** (<=> *trustworthiness* ).

###### Men have two major complaints about women: 
- “There’s too much fighting, 
- and there’s not enough sex.”


##### CCL
CCL: both are in a relationship and feel lonely. 
SOLUTION: Learn **attunement**
**Attunement** create genuine emotional connection.


##### Attune
Lack of attunement creat fights as a result from men dismissing women’s emotions instead of attuning to them. You dismiss a woman’s emotions every time you 
- try to fix them,
- distract her from them, 
- minimize them, 
- mock them, 
- or ignore them altogether


###### Logical explanation:
1. Trait women want most: trustworthiness.
2. Trust is built through: emotional connection.
3. Emotional connection is created through: attunement.
4. Therefore, emotional attunement = trustworthiness.

> Woman need to feel respected, heard, and connected.


###### How to Attune
HOW to Attunement : Give your undivided attention when it’s needed. 
<=> Action to take WHEN she wants to talk to you, turn off the game, put away your cell phone, and show by your actions that you care about her and about what she is saying. 

>[!info] Attention equals affection.

TURN TOWARD. This is not a metaphor or a new age expression. Physically. Turn. Toward. Your. Partner.  Women equate intimacy with conversation that is face-to-face and eyeball-to-eyeball.
VS men are side-by-side to express attention (*due to hunting in the day ??*)

UNDERSTAND. No matter what she is saying, the goal is understanding. 
You understand is by asking questions. Ask  what she is feeling and what it all means to her. This part of attuning is not about saying “I understand”; it’s about **attempting to understand why this is important to her**.

NONDEFENSIVELY LISTEN. When a woman is talking about or is upset about is you. Don’t react. Whether or not you agree with her reactions or how she sees reality, her feelings are real to her in that moment. You only need to listen to her express them.

EMPATHIZE. Understanding is an intellectual pursuit, while empathy is an emotional pursuit. Try to feel how a woman is feeling, regardless of whether it's logic or not. You can ask her how she feels (genius) and try to cold read her. Let her know that you value how she feels and that it makes sense to you that she would feel this way. **Show empathy.
Show compassion. It’s not about being wrong or being right**.
-> goal: she feel safe and heard.


RECAP: listening is sexier than talking. Asking questions is sexier than broadcasting. Being genuinely interested in her is much more important than trying to be interesting to her.

NOTE: Men are often bigger than women and their voices are deeper and louder. If you use your voice or your size to intimidate or to make a point, even if you don’t intend to do this, a woman will not feel physically safe with you and will not trust you completely.


##### other
For women, being sexual is equivalent to being vulnerable


Don’t think you can give her logical reasons why she feel something. Acceptance is the key. As you learn to accept her emotions, you may learn to accept your own.

##### Learn from the Children
The goal for men is generally dispensing with the emotion so that the play and fun (relationship) can continue.

For the girls, the goal isn’t the game and stopping the play isn’t a drawback or a disruption of the fun. Emotions are not a problem for girls. They are a good thing, an opportunity for intimacy. To girls, expressing the feelings requires taking a risk, opening up, and trusting one another.


##### The Bottom Line
For a woman, there are no negative emotions. For a woman, there is no “point” to being emotional. Emotions just are. For women, they’re as natural as breathing.
Emotions are opportunities for intimacy. This bears repeating. They are opportunities to build emotional connection, and they are opportunities to demonstrate your trustworthiness.

When you give up trying to change her into someone more like you, you can attune to who she really is. -> the goal ain't to marry a clone of you. 



#### RECAP
WHAT WOMEN WANT MOST: TRUSTWORTHINESS. number one thing women want from you is trustworthiness. You demonstrate trustworthiness by being who you say you are and doing what you say you are going to do. You show up and you showup as yourself.

THE SECRET OF TRUSTWORTHINESS: ATTUNEMENT. Women need to feel emotionally connected and emotionally safe. This happens through attunement. When a woman wants to connect with you, especially when she’s upset about something, you A-TT-U-N-E: You Attend to her, you physically Turn Toward her, you seek to Understand her by asking questions, you Non-defensively Listen, and you Empathize by accepting and affirming her emotions.

DON’T BEAT YOUR CHEST. Women also need to feel physically safe with you. A Hero never uses his size or his voice to intimidate a woman or make a point. A lack of physical safety is a deal breaker with women.

TRUSTWORTHINESS = LESS FIGHTING AND MORE SEX. When a woman feels emotionally connected to you and when you demonstrate your trustworthiness, the result is less fighting and more sex. Win- Win-WIN.


YOU MIGHT BE A ZERO IF. . .
- You dismiss her emotions or immediately try to fix them.
- You use your voice, size, or strength to intimidate. 
- You check your e-mail while she’s trying to talk to you or in other ways that don’t give her your attention when she needs it or asks for it. 
- You don’t show up when you say you will.
- You check out other women when you are with her.
- You keep secrets.
- You lie
