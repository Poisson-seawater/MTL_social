##### Rhythm
All human and mammalian bodies are rhythmic in many ways (breathing, hormone, sleep-wave ...).
However, women are more complicated rhythmically than men, as their hormone levels rise and fall during each month with their menstrual cycles.

General guideline of menstrual cycles:
- During the first 2 weeks of the menstrual cycle (when estrogen is peaking), women are friendlier, more talkative, more socially relaxed, calmer, and more emotionally sensitive. 
- During the second 2 weeks of the menstrual cycle (when progesterone is peaking), women can be more irritable, more stressed, and less calm, plus they want to be alone more. They can also be more focused on their interior worlds and more creative.
- At ovulation, women may be more emotional and possibly more interested in sex,
- It is common for women to experience more emotional sensitivity, irritability, stress, and sadness when progesterone levels start to drop just before menstruation—commonly referred to as PMS, or premenstrual syndrome.
	- can be quite severe depression and anxiety.
	- physical symptoms such as headaches, backaches, cramping, and bloating. 
	- There are helpful things women can do to minimize PMS, ranging from exercise, avoiding caffeine, and taking B vitamins, herbs, or progesterone to full treatment with antidepressant therapy
	- WHEN she is in this moment say: "“Sounds to me like you’re feeling really sad at the moment. Talk to me. I want to hear what you’re thinking and feeling right now.”"

=> The only constant is change. She may change from cycle to cycle. 

A woman’s needs and emotions can vary throughout her menstrual cycle, although the differences may be extreme for some women and barely noticeable for others.

She will also pass the throught perimenopause and menopause; whom may increase irritability.
During perimenopausal a partner take care of her, let her get more sleep, and doesn’t take her mood personally.



#### Hormones and Sex
it’s important for men to know that they are not necessarily meeting the identical woman, in the living room or the bedroom, from day to day. And she does not want the identical man from day to day, either. Her needs, feelings, and thoughts may vary depending on where she is in her cycle.
=> change behavior according to where she is !!

Testosterone drive sex libido. Men does have on average more testosterone. Especially during teen to young adult. 
Note: In men, the brain centers for sex and for vision are closely linked, which is why just looking at women turns men on.

"Women need a reason for sex. Men just need a place."


##### Women and Fear
Women experience fear in a very different way than men. Ex: men rarely feel physically under danger (fist-fight, war ...); WHILE woman feel physically vulnerable it all the time. Plus woman are twice likely to develop PTSD than man.

STUDY When they asked men and women what they were feeling after having been **startled**, women reported feeling afraid. Women felt fear. Men reported feeling angry.

High stress causes men to get less fearful, VS
women get more fearful and are more likely to be afraid in the future. 
Women feel fear in response to a stressful situation. They also experience much more fear over the course of a lifetime, and once they feel fear in a situation, they will be even more afraid when that situation arises again in the future.

This is why women need to feel emotionally and physically safe with you. Because their biological and physiological needs are different.

WHEN a woman is afraid, hold her hand. The more she like you, the more her fear will shut down. 

Always walk behind or next to a woman (never in front). 

#### CHEAT SHEET for HEROES
RHYTHMICITY. Understand the effect of hormones on the day-to-day emotional state of a woman. Know that these influences are different in every woman and will change in a woman as she goes through different stages of her life. Her sex drive and what she needs from you will also change depending on where she is in her cycle. Ask questions to find out what she needs.

FEAR. Women experience fear differently than men. Women are more easily fear conditioned, meaning that if you both go through a fearful experience, shewill be twice as likely to feel fear again in a similar situation. Offering comfort to a woman when she is afraid can immediately shut down her brain’s fear response. That is, of course, assuming she’s happy with you. If she’s unhappy with you, your comfort may not be effective.


YOU MIGHT BE A ZERO IF. . .
You ask her if she’s having her period or “PMSing” when she is angry, emotional, or moody in some way. 
- You dismiss her fear as irrational.
- You don’t offer comfort when she is afraid or fearful.
- You grope her or engage in any unwanted sexual activity.
- You walk in front of her rather than behind or beside her when you are walking together on the street. 
	- There’s a reason the codes of chivalry have a man walk on the outside: to protect his partner.
- You don’t respect her physical or emotional vulnerability.
- You purposely frighten her because you think it’s amusing (or because you now want to check out her startle response after reading about that study).
