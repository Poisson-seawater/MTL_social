-> [[_ Resum tantra _]]
-> [[Becoming Her Best Ever]]

PASSION BEGINS IN the mind. When a woman feels passionate—whether it’s about her work, her family, or you—her body comes alive, her emotions are heightened, and she is capable of experiencing an incredible amount of pleasure and having amazing sensual experiences. 
=> A woman’s mind and heart are her most powerful erogenous zones.

To truly know a woman’s body you have to first know her mind and heart. -> SO ATTUNE !!

##### The 99 Percent
To truly make love to a woman you have to make love to her whole body with your mind, your eyes, your words, your heart, and your touch.

The other big secret to the female anatomy is that there’s not a single part of her body that is not an erogenous zone if touched in the right way.


#### Recap
A woman’s mind is her most powerful erogenous  zone. 
- She needs to feel physically and emotionally safe and connected with you in order to feel aroused and experience pleasure.

The sexual anatomy of a woman is complex.
- Explore what feels good to her and help her show you what gives her pleasure.
-  A woman has various spots—G-spot, A-spot, U-spot—that may be highly charged and erotic for her if touched and stroked the right way. 
	- Explore the spots that feel good to her, but don’t pressure her to feel pleasure in any particular spot. 
- Every woman—and every woman’s body—is different.
- The erogenous zones of a woman are not limited to her genitals. (The same is true for men.) 
	- Any part of her body can be a source of extreme pleasure with the right touch. The skin, neck, ears, lips, shoulders, breasts, back, and thighs of a woman can all be erotic.

> Her pleasure will increase your pleasure.
