##### The First Kiss
philematology—the science of kissing.

The first kiss matters. It matters a lot. 66% of woman end a relation because of kiss. As lips have lots of nerves and pheromone link to it.
Good first kiss:
- oral hygene
- be confident -> read her non-verbal (don't ask).
- read the signals: she will give most of her attention to your eyes and lips. She may lick her own lips or bite down on her bottom lip. Look into her eyes. Look at her lips. See if she’s smiling.
- go slow: approach and observe how she react
- kiss: Touch your lips slowly to hers and simply pause. Feel the sensations. Be in the moment. Increase the pressure and respond as she responds. If she opens her mouth, then gently touch tongues.
- Touch her: A kiss happens with the lips, but the hands and arms enhance it. Stroke her face or her hair. Put your arms around her. Cup the back of her neck. Leave hand resting limply at your sides. Making her feel safe in your arms will make her want to be there more often. The first kiss is probably not the time to go for her breasts.


#### Recap
Pheromones are chemical signals that lead to attraction and a sense of well-being when you are with
someone who just “smells right.”
A woman’s sense of smell is much more acute than a man’s, and your pheromones will smell right to
some women and not to others. It’s not personal.
You do have control over your non-pheromone-related smell. Practice good hygiene accordingly.
A bad first kiss is a relationship killer.
A woman will remember a first kiss more than she will remember losing her virginity and other big life
moments. Make that kiss one worth remembering.
Kissing releases a flood of feel-good hormones.
You can learn to give a great first kiss.

you make your move too soon.)

You don’t build anticipation for a kiss and move in too fast.
You ram your tongue down her throat and assault her with saliva-filled sloppiness.
You disregard the importance of tender touch during a kiss.
You don’t make her feel safe in your arms.
