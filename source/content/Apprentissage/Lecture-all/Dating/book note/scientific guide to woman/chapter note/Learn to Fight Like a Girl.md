> The make-up sex is a myth (for long term at least).

Here’s the headline: A woman will not have sex with you if she is mad, upset, or feeling like you don’t hear, understand, or care about her feelings and whatever it is that is causing her to be upset in the first place (whether it has to do with you or not). 
- You can’t bully her out of being sad or mad, 
	- and you can’t reason her out of being sad or mad. 
- You can’t solve the problem of her being sad or mad by applying your keen logic, reasoning, or negotiating skills.

When conflict happens, a woman wants one thing: a good listener. A woman’s goal in conflict is to be better understood by her partner.


##### Conflict Happens

There are no real differences between men and women in reason to feeling anger.
The differences lie, according to research, is in how men and women manage their anger.

The causes of women’s anger could be rooted in one or more of three categories: 
- powerlessness,
	- if you are not listening to your woman (or you refuse to relinquish control of the remote), 
		- she is going to get angry because she will feel powerless.
- injustice,
	- If you don’t treat her as an equal in the decision making process or if you betray her trust, 
		- she is going to feel injustice and she is going to get angry. 
- and the irresponsibility of other people.  
	- If you don’t do your fair share of work around the house or don’t show up when you say you are going to (irresponsibility of others),
		- she is going to be angry with you.

They are different in the ways men and women experience and express their anger. When men are angry they are more likely to use physical aggression, passive aggression, and revenge to handle their anger. women stay angry longer, are less likely to directly express their anger, and become more resentful than men. Women also tended to use indirect aggression rather than direct aggression, meaning that if a woman is angry with you, she is more likely to get silent than to yell at you to your face.


##### Flood Insurance
Men get more emotionally flooded and overwhelmed than women do in a conflict situation. And second, once flooded, only men who are able to reduce their heart rates are able to decrease the amount of criticism, defensiveness, contempt, and stonewalling they contribute to the conflict (*These four things are what we call the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in a relationship*).


You know you are flooded if your heart rate is over 100 beats per minute (or 80, if you are in great physical shape). It mean you start secreting adrenaline and launch into DPA. In DPA, you lose access to your sense of humor, cannot listen very well (*hearing and peripheral vision are compromised*), and tend to repeat yourself. -> impossible to communicate when in this physiologically aroused state.

Flooding has three major components: (1) the shock
of attack and the need to defend, (2) emotional shutdown, and (3) the inability to selfsoothe.


WHEN  you get emotionally flooded? 3 simple scientific strategies proven to reduce heart rate:
1.  breathe 
2. Count to 10. 
	1. Breathing and counting to 10 are ways of downregulating or self-soothing. When you take a deep breath you stimulate the vagus nerve, which in turn reduces your heart rate and lowers your blood pressure.
3. If you still feel no noticeable decrease, take a break.
	1. SAY: "You know what, I’m having a hard time listening to you right now, and I will come back in 30 minutes so we can continue to talk."

When women have been traumatized in the past, either physically, sexually, or emotionally, they too will flood. Their flooding look like:
-  listlessly stare into your eyes, but their eyes are glazed over; 
	- they make it look like nobody is home.
- They are physically present but emotionally absent—this is their way of withdrawing to find safety. 
- In order to “return” from her own flooding response, she needs to feel safe and to self-soothe, as well.

###### Break
The break needs to be at least 20 minutes long because it takes that long to diffuse the flooding hormones.
Need to get distract: 
- that mean don't think about her (even her positive trait) nor the fight
- a walk, read a book, listen to music, go for a run, do some yoga, or meditate. -> get emotionally distract

> Create a break ritual so your partner knows what’s up and has some idea about what you are going through when you are in the middle of a conflict.


##### There Will Be Issues
They realize that when a woman is in pain over something, she will not always say so, and that pain may sometimes come out as a criticism.


To find out where it hurts, use those 3 important questions -> [[LOVE resum.canvas|LOVE resum]]: 
1. What do you need?
2. What are you concerned about?
3. What are you feeling?


If the woman in your life is criticizing you, or   complaining, or bringing up yet another issue she has with you, at the heart of it she wants to be closer, or feel safer, or trust you more.
-> just listen, attune and finding out why your girlfriend or wife is in pain and what you can do about it.



NOTE: Men are evolutionarily wired to be hypervigilant, aggressive, and to go on the attack if they are being threatened (verbally can trigger this).
