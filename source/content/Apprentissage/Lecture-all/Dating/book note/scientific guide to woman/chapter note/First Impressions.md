Understand: you are the driver, she (by non-verbal) is the green light. 

##### The First Conversation
If trustworthiness is about creating safety (physical and emotional), the way you create safety in a conversation is by being a good listener and being genuinely interested.


Women are impressed with a guy who has emotional energy, who is passionate about whatever he’s talking about, and who asks questions and really listens to the answers.

Every woman has a story and your job is to invite her to tell that story. Ask her questions about her work, her life, and her interests, and keep it positive. If she starts thinking about negative things, she’s going to associate those negative things with you.

> Conversation is an art, and it’s an art that puts the other person at center stage.


During this first conversation (and all future conversations), look into her eyes while she’s speaking.

Speak at your fundamental frequency. To find your fundamental frequency, stand in the shower and use your thumb and index finger to lightly pinch the bridge of your nose. Now hum, varying the frequency. Your fundamental frequency causes the bones of your nose to vibrate the most
voice business is subtle, note that 
 - “breathy or tender” deep voice is also good
 - lower-pitched voices men are considered more attractive
 - men with deep voices have more children

-> Anxiety makes the pitch of your voice rise.

People like people who like them. If you like her, show her through words, actions, and your conversation and listening skills. Undivided attention is a powerful aphrodisiac.

People naturally take on each other’s mannerisms and like each other as a result. You can use social glue on a date. It happens automatically if you look at the woman—and pay attention.


THEN Ask for her phone number or ask her out on a date. And when you do ask, if it’s appropriate, touch her forearm (1 to 2 second) while you do it. -> light tactile contact.


##### The First Date
doing something adventurous with a little bit of fear mixed in can be helpful on your date. The physiological response to fear is quite similar to the physiological response to arousal.

Being a gentleman is most important. Open doors, walk on the busy side of the sidewalk, walk in stride with her, demonstrate your protective instincts.

Unlike men, women are much more geared for collaboration, not competition, so if you are discussing something and you have opposing viewpoints, don’t tell her she is wrong. You can say, “That’s interesting. Tell me more.” After listening and responding with interest, it’s okay to say, “Okay, here’s my viewpoint,” but don’t present your differences in a way that devalues her.

Don’t talk about ex-girlfriends. Don’t tell stories that turn you into a victim. Insecurity is an attraction killer every time.
