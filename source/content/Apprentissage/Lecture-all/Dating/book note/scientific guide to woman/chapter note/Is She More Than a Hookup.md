GOAL: Reading a Woman’s True Profile.


##### Her True Profile
Watch how your romantic partner treats her pets, friends, and family, and you’ll get a
good idea about how she will treat you in a relationship.

###### HEART.
Try to notice if she is kind or if she complains about her friends and family all
of the time. If something negative happens, does she blame others? Does she take any
responsibility for miscommunications? 

Is she “neurotic”? The technical term “neurotic” really means two possible cognitive styles: 
- (1) she sees potential negativity everywhere, so she approaches any new situation with an expectation of total disaster, and/or 
- (2) she ruminates endlessly on every small negative event. 

###### MIND
Do her words and actions match up? 
Is she trusting or suspicious of you?

###### BODY
Is there sexual chemistry and attraction? 


#### Recap
Oxytocin can cloud your judgment and lower your fear response. It is the bonding hormone that gets released during orgasm and from affection. That’s why platonic sex is an oxymoron.
Limerence is that first stage of attraction or love during which you obsessively think about the other person, can’t sleep, feel highly sensual, and are high on love. The cascade of hormones flooding your body during limerence can cause you to ignore the warning signs or red flags in any potential relationship.

You can be attracted to someone because of your hormones or because of imprinting from your first 18 months. Ask yourself why you might be drawn to a particular woman, and stay aware of your conscious and unconscious motivations.
A woman is more than a hookup if you feel a connection in body, mind, and heart.

If there’s no physical connection or chemistry at first, there never will be.

###### YOU MIGHT BE A ZERO IF. . .
You ignore the warning signs and disregard the red flags in a potential relationship.
You settle for a Damsel in Distress, a Princess, a Competer, or a Drama Queen.
You make relationship decisions based on physical attraction alone.
You let a woman make you feel bad about yourself, or you put up with rude or difficult behavior.
You believe you can have sex and not get attached.
You think you can “fix” her.
