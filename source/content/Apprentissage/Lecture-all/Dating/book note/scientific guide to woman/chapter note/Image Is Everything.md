GOAL: Understanding How Women View Their Bodies

In order to truly understand a woman’s body, you have to first understand a woman’s relationship with her body.

A Hero lets a woman know through small comments just how great she looks in that color dress or how amazing her shoulder looks with the light hitting it just that way,  how beautiful her face looks in the moonlight and how gorgeous her smile is. how stunning she looks nursing the baby or how pretty she is first thing in the morning, with sleep still in her eyes and a face free of makeup. how wonderful it feels to make love to her and shows her just how much he loves every part of her.

Women view between 400 and 600 advertisements a day, and one out of every 11 of these ads has a direct message about what ideal feminine beauty is supposed to look like. 
Most women have a painful relationship with the image they see in the mirror.
=> remember to compliment her all the time (especially on bad day)!!!

“Do I look fat in this?” ONLY good answer: “You are beautiful no matter what you wear.”


When women take forever to get out the door, it’s not vanity— it’s because she is constantly reminded that people will treat her differently based on how she looks. It’s not right or fair, but that’s what women are up against.

> Nothing cuts deeper for a woman than criticism of the way she look.
> It mean any comment about food, sport, or related to look !!!


What you can do is try to understand what it’s like to have a chronic and painful preoccupation with appearance and to feel like you are always coming up short. You can try to understand the tremendous need for social approval that causes women to constantly diet, shop for new clothing, overexercise, check their looks in the mirror, and consider plastic surgery a “solution” to the normal process of aging.


A woman’s selfesteem is heavily dependent on her own appraisal of her body. -> help her feel beautiful in the mirror of your eyes.
HOW: She will feel beautiful if you only have eyes for her when you are with her. She will feel beautiful if you show her she’s beautiful by loving every part of her with your eyes, your hands, and your lips.

If she isn’t comfortable with her body, she’s not going to be comfortable sharing it with you.  A woman’s desire is dependent on her feeling desirable.

> greatest sex organ a woman has is her mind.


#### Recap
A woman is exposed to hundreds of ads a day that tell her what her body is supposed to look like.
Women rarely measure up to the ideal standard of beauty portrayed by the fashion and entertainment
industries. Let her know she is beautiful exactly as she is.
A woman’s relationship with her body is fragile, and even one “joke” or mean comment about her
weight, size, or attractiveness can cut deeply. Heroes never criticize a woman’s body.
Men can’t reverse the constant societal pressures to be thin and beautiful, but men can make any
woman feel beautiful.
Compliment her. Show her you adore and desire her just as she is.
If a woman has a poor body image or believes you don’t find her attractive, she will not be
comfortable with you sexually.
YOU MIGHT BE A ZERO IF. . .
You criticize a woman’s body.
You check out other women when you are with her, or you comment on the body parts of another
woman.
You suggest that she go on a diet or start to exercise.
You tell her she does in fact look fat in that outfit. The only correct response is, “You look beautiful in
everything you wear.”
You fail to make her feel desired, adored, or beautiful.
You compare her looks to other women or past girlfriends.
You treat her like a sexual object rather than a real person.
