#SurfPhilosophy/dating/scientifiqueGuide

=> Woman change all the time, always a different person.

Never stop dating her. Never stop getting to know her. Never stop connecting with her. Give her your attention, your time, and your support, and be there when she needs you. Listen to her. This is how you build trust, and it also doesn’t hurt that listening is like Viagra for a woman.

##### A Word about [[What Do Women Really Want|Trust]]
It's THE ONE criteria. It mean to be there when it count. 
That is, [[_Attune]] and [[Qu'est ce que l'Écoute|listen]] when she need it. 


##### Affair-Proofing Your Relationship
-> [[Habit to build]] 
THE 6-SECOND KISS. Every time you leave one another and first see each other after being apart, *whether it’s to go to work, the grocery store, or the gym*, kiss for 6 seconds. Because it need 6s for the oxytocin to starts flowing.

DATE HER: once a week !!!

GET TO KNOW HER. Remember when you could talk for hours and you never got tired of learning new things about each other? This doesn’t have to end.

APPRECIATE HER. Find some way every day to show your appreciation and gratitude that this woman is in your life. Compliment her, thank her, admire her, show her with your words and your actions that you love and value her. Tell her she is beautiful. Let her know you desire her. Do something nice for her.

HONOR HER DREAMS. Too often, women will put their own dreams aside for the sake of the family, or the relationship ...
Do everything in your power to help her fulfill them.
