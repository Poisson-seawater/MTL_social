GOAL: [[3 stage of Love romantique.canvas]]

##### Three Stages of Love
at the beginning of
relationships you are in the first stage of love (or lust), called limerence. During this
stage you are in a state of chemical confusion and constant oxytocin overdose. This
heady cocktail of infatuation is made up of oxytocin, dopamine, phenylethylamine (PEA),
testosterone, estrogen, serotonin, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
BUT remember: 
1. Oxytocin can make you blind
2. succes in being in Limerence state doesn't mean she is the one
	1. nor that it's mutual.


Stage two is all about building trust. This stage usually takes place during the first
couple years of a relationship and as you progress toward living together. If evolutionary biology tells
us that stage one is about finding the best genetic fit for mating, stage two is about
finding out who will help you care for your offspring—whether you are consciously
planning to have children or not.

In this stage, you’ve chosen to go down the rabbit hole
with your partner and to take an amazing journey together. You are commited to another
person’s wellbeing as much as you are committed to your own.
third stage only works
out if you are both committed to monogamy and mutual sacrifice for one another. If you
are not monogamous in this stage, you open the door to experiencing limerence (stage
one) love with another person. Those cocktails are powerful! In stage three, you still
have oxytocin flowing when you have an orgasm and when you show affection to one
another, and this keeps you bonded, but the rest of the chemicals in the cascade quiet
down.

In stage 3: You have created a sense of shared meaning and purpose in your lives; trust and loyalty.


Research show that if you didn't pass by the 3 stages of love, you will always ended up wondering if you make the right choise.


##### But How Do I Know for Sure?
Statistically is 10 000 potential "one" for each one of us.
If you feel at home, and instinct tell you "she is the one". Then she is the one. 

The one criteria to check is the emotion match; as the ability to exchange about each other feeling and feel understand. Love language is also important !!

-> have to be officially married to have the health benefit of living longer.

=> for a man, the realationship is the 1st place to get your need met.
