> seduction is about quiting the mondain of life

The combination of these
two elements, enchantment
and surrender, is, then,
essential to the love which
we are discussing. . . .
What exists in love is
surrender due to
enchantment.
—JOSÉ ORTEGA Y GASSET

What is good?—All that
heightens the feeling of
power, the will to power,
power itself in man. •
What is bad?—All that
proceeds from weakness. •
What is happiness?—The
feeling that power
increases—that a resistance
is overcome.
—FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE,


seducer need to understand the word troughout someone else eye and play according to it.
