###### Intro victims
Nobody in this world feels whole and complete; Hence **victims are categorized by what they feel they are missing in life**—adventure, attention, romance, a naughty experience, mental or physical stimulation, etc. **When we fall in love, it is often with someone who seems to fill that gap.**

People are constantly **giving out signals** (*check [[__ Non verbal|Non verbal]] do [[On Body Language and Cold Reading|cold reading]]*) as to **what they lack**. In studying potential victims, learn to see the reality behind the appearance. 
- *A timid person may yearn to play the star; a prude may long for a transgressive thrill.*
- be careful to not be taken in by outward appearances. 
	- we often develop a social exterior designed specifically to disguise our weaknesses and lacks.

**CCL**: The victim long for completeness, whether the illusion of it or the reality. We may call them victims of a seduction, but they are almost always willing victims.


>[!info] Never try to seduce your own type.

## Part 2: the seductive process
###### intro
You will not seduce anyone with only your engaging personality. It is a process that occurs over time—the longer you take and the slower you go, the deeper you will penetrate into the mind of your victim. It is an art that requires patience, focus, and strategic thinking. You need to always be one step ahead of your victim, throwing dust in their eyes, casting a spell, keeping them off balance.


The chapters are placed in a loose order: initial contact to the successful conclusion.

Mindset of seduction
- take time, need strategic planing
- Mystery is the lifeblood of seduction and to maintain it you have to constantly surprise your victims, stir things up, even shock them. 
	- A seduction should never settle into a comfortable routine. 
- The middle and later chapters will instruct you in the art of alternating hope and despair, pleasure and pain, until your victims weaken and succumb. 
- A seducer cannot be timid or merciful.
- We are all trying to escape, to feel feels whole and complete
- There is nothing more effective in seduction than making the seduced think that they are the ones doing the seducing.
- Seduction is a game of reducing suspicion and resistance.


4 phase:
1. getting the victim to think of you; 
2. gaining access to their emotions by creating moments of pleasure and confusion;
3. going deeper by working on their unconscious, stirring up repressed desires;
4. and finally, inducing physical surrender

> The seductive process may be thought of as a kind of initiation ritual, in which you are uprooting people from their habits, giving them novel experiences, putting them through tests, before initiating them into a new life.


When it comes time to apply these tactics, you will want to pick and choose which ones are appropriate for your particular victim; sometimes only a few are sufficient, depending on the level of resistance you meet and the complexity of your victim's problems. These tactics are equally applicable to social and political seductions, minus the sexual component.
==At all cost, resist the temptation to hurry to the climax of your seduction, or to improvise.==


### Phase One: Separation - Stiring Interest and Desire
Your victims live in their own worlds, their minds occupied with anxieties and daily concerns. **Your goal in this initial phase is to slowly separate them from that closed world and fill their minds with thoughts of you**.

###### Sommaire Part 1
[[Art seduction - Part 1.canvas|Art seduction - Part 1]]
- [[Choose the Right Victim]]
	- Check her [[Non Verbal - Dating.canvas|Non Verbal]] for sign of interest
	- THEN get your victims' attention, stir interest in you.
- [[Create a False Sense of Security—Approach Indirectly]]
	- IF resistant or difficult,
		- THEN first win their friendship after become lover
			- friendly conversation to learn about her: characters, tastes, weaknesses, childhood yearnings that govern their adult behavior.
			- Make her comfortable with you *-> [[deepen the conversation]]?*
			- offhand slight physical contact, to spark a different thought, catch them off-guard: goal is to give them the lead ([[making girls chase]])
	- ==Learn to disguise your feelings and let people figure out what is happening for themselves. Never give the impression that you are angling for something==
	- IF NOT: bored and less difficult to reach, 
		- THEN a more dramatic approach will work, either
			- fascinating them with a mysterious presence  
			- OR seeming to be someone who is coveted and fought over by others 
- [[Send Mixed Signals]]
	- ONCE the victim is properly intrigued, 
		- THEN you need to transform their interest into something stronger—**desire**.
	- HOW: be hard to figure out by sending mixed signals - paradox -> goal is to create a debt in your caracter
		- *appear innocent, but have a devilish eve*
	- IF you display too much of one quality—even if it is a noble one, like knowledge or efficiency—and people will feel that you lack humanity
- [[Appear to be an object of Desire - Create Triangle]]

	- SO create an aura of desirability—of being wanted and courted by many. 
		- MAKE Victims create a point of vanity  to be the preferred object of your attention, to win you away from a crowd of admirers. -> use member of the opposite sex.
		- -impose another person (or more) between you and your victim, and subtly make your victim aware of how much this other person wants you. 
	- OR use **contrast**
- [[Create a Need - Stir Anxiety and Discontent]]
	- Desire is generally preceded by feelings of emptiness, of something missing inside that needs fulfillment. 
		- You must deliberately instill such feelings, make your victims aware of the adventure and romance that are lacking in their lives
		- If they see you as the one to fill their emptiness (*Desire*),
			- THEN interest will blossom into desire. 
	- Make them: ensure about the futur or their identity, depress, remind how bored their are in their life. <=> **open a wound**
		- USE insinuation or indirect comparaison to me and others
	- Anxiety, a feeling of lack and need, is the precursor of all desire. 
- [[Master the Art of Insinuation]]
	- make your targets feel dissatisfied with insinuation like
		- doubt, desire, interest in her
	- The desire should be stoked by subtly planting ideas in their minds, hints of the seductive pleasures that await them.
	- **HOW: Create a ==sublanguage==**
		- —*bold statements followed by retraction and apology, ambiguous comments, banal talk combined with alluring glances*—
		- that enters the target's unconscious to convey your real meaning. Make everything suggestive (*insinuation MUST be too subtle at the moment !!*)
	- USE: slip of the tongue
- [[Enter Their Spirit]] 
	- [[Mirroring]] your victims' values, indulging them in their wants and moods will charm and delight them
		- conform to their moods, adapt to their tastes, play along with whatever they send your way. 
			- Once you have entered their spirit you can make them enter yours, at a point when it is too late to turn back.
	- END: Without realizing how, more and more of their thoughts now revolve around you. 
	- ==**REMEMBER** : People truly love themselves, but what they love most of all is to see their ideas and tastes reflected in another person. This validates them. Their habitual insecurity vanishes.
	-  When you are mirroring someone, do not stop at the person they have become; ==enter the spirit of that ideal person they wanted to be.==
- [[Create Temptation]], and they will follow your lead.
	- search in their past their desire !!
	- keep the future gains vague, though, and somewhat out of reach. 
	-  create a temptation that is stronger than the daily variety. It has to be focused on them, aimed at them as individuals—at their weakness. 
	- **People struggle to maintain security and a sense of balance in their lives.**
- **NOW use something stronger:** 
	- lure them with an irresistible **pleasure** or **adventure**


### Phase Two: Lead Astray - Creating Pleasure and Confusion
###### Intro
Your victims are intrigued and their desire for you is growing, but their attachment is weak and at any moment they could decide to turn back. 
The **goal** is to **lead your victims so far astray—*keeping them emotional and confused, giving them pleasure but making them want more*—that retreat is no longer possible.**


###### Sommaire Part 2
[[Art of seduction Part 2.canvas|Art of seduction Part 2]]
- 9: [[Keep Them in Suspense - What Comes Next]]?
	- Springing on them a **pleasant surprise** will make them see you as **delightfully unpredictable, but will also keep them off balance.**
		- Behave in a way that leaves them wondering, "What are you up to?" 
	- let the target made some jugement about you, accentuate them 
		- THEN changed their minds about you, surprise them again
	- Falling in love involves anticipation; we are about to head off in a new direction, enter a new life, where everything will be strange. The seduced wants to be led, like in a dance. If you are predictable, the charm wears off; everyday life is predictable. 
	- HOW
		-  Take them to some new place as if it only just occurred to you, 
			- suddenly reveal some secret.
		- THEN Made emotionally vulnerable, they will be too bewildered to see through you.
			- AND Anything that happens suddenly seems natural, and anything that seems natural has a seductive charm.
- 10: [[use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion]]
	- The artful use of soft and pleasant **words will intoxicate them and stimulate fantasies**
		- always think first of your targets, and of what will be pleasant to their ears. There will be many times when silence is best.
	- The key is to **see words as a tool not for communicating true thoughts and feelings but for confusing, delighting, and intoxicating.**
	- The trick to making them listen is to say what they want to hear, to fill their ears with whatever is pleasant to them. 
	- learn to aim your flattery directly at a person's insecurities.
		- Make it a surprise, something no one else has thought to flatter before—something you can describe as a talent or positive quality that others have not noticed.
	- the most pleasant thing to hear is the promise of something wonderful, a vague but rosy future that is just around the corner. 
- 11. [[Pay Attention to Details]]
	- Aesthetic touches and pleasant little **rituals will titillate their senses, distracting their minds**
	- Dress according to her taste
- 12. [[Poeticize Your Presence]]
	- Your greatest danger in this phase is the mere hint of routine or familiarity. 
		- SO: You need to **maintain some mystery**, to **keep a little distance** so that in your absence **your victims become obsessed with you**
	- The goal is to make yourself **crystalize**
	- Avoid the taint of familiarity and commonness.
- 13. [[Disarm Through Strategic Weakness and Vulnerability]]
	- They may realize they are falling for you, but they must never suspect how much of this has come from your manipulations.
		- SO A well-timed **display of your weakness, of how emotional you have become under their influence**, will help cover your tracks
	- Do not struggle against your vulnerabilities or try to repress them, but put them into play. Learn to transform them into power
	    - A person's vulnerability, what they seem to be unable to control, is often what is most seductive about them.
	-  The best way to cover your tracks is to make the other person feel superior and stronger.
- 14. [[Confuse Desire and Reality - The Perfect Illusion]]
	- To excite your victims and make them highly emotional, 
		- you must **give them the feeling that they are actually living some of the fantasies you have stirred in their imagination**
	- Every culture has a pool of god or hero from the distant and not-so-distant past. You hint at a similarity, in spirit and in appearance—but you are flesh and blood.
	- When our emotions are engaged, we often have trouble seeing things as they are. 
	- To compensate for the difficulties in their lives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming, imagining a future full of adventure, success, and romance.
		- The perfect illusion is one that does not depart too much from reality, but has a touch of the unreal to it, like a waking dream, head the seduced to a point of confusion in which they can no longer tell the difference between illusion and reality (like the salt analogy for writing)
- 15. [[Isolate the Victim]]
	- By giving them only a part of the fantasy, you will keep them coming back for more. 
		- Focusing your attention on them so that the rest of the world fades away, even taking them on a trip, will lead them far astray
	- Isolation can be physical or phycological
	-  replace the familiar things you have cut them off from with a new home, a new series of comforts...
		- 

END: There is no turning back.


### Phase Three: The Precipice - Deepening the Effect Through Extreme Measures   

The goal in this phase is to make everything deeper—
- the effect you have on their mind, 
- feelings of love and attachment, tension within your victims. 

HOW: With your hooks deep into them, you can then push them back and forth, between hope and despair, until they weaken and snap.

###### Sommaire - Part 3
[[Art of seduction part 3.canvas|Art of seduction part 3]]
- (16: [[Prove Yourself]]) 
	- Showing how far you are willing to go for your victims, doing some noble or chivalrous deed will create a powerful jolt, spark an intensely positive reaction.
	- One well-timed action that shows how far you are willing to go to win them over will dispel their doubts.
	- What MATTER is that you seem to act on their behalf without thought for yourself or the consequences.
	- is spontaneous action
		- go deeper than what is needed
		- make it seems like it cost you more than it has
	- OR plan a brave deed
- 17:  [[Effect a Regression]]
	- Everyone has scars, repressed desires, and unfinished business from childhood.
		- Bring these desires and wounds to the surface, make your victims feel they are getting what they never got as a child and you will penetrate deep into their psyche, stir uncontrollable emotions 
	- Because the responsibilities of adult life we tend to overvalue and idealize our childhood
	- While they talk, maintain the therapist's pose—attentive but quiet, making occasional, nonjudgmental comments. 
- (18: [[Stir up the Transgressive and Taboo]]). 
	- Now you can take your victims past their limits, getting them to act out their dark sides, adding a sense of danger to your seduction 
	- Give your targets the feeling that they are committing a kind of crime, a deed whose guilt they share with you.
	- Create public moments in which the two of you know something that those around you do not.
		 - It could be phrases and looks that only you recognize, a secret.
	- There must be obstacles to overcome, social norms to flout, laws to break, before the seduction can be consummated. It might seem that a permissive society imposes few limits; find some.
- (19: [[use Spiritual Lures]])
	- You need to deepen the spell, and nothing will more confuse and enchant your victims than giving your seduction a spiritual veneer. It is not lust that motivates you, but destiny, divine thoughts and everything elevated . 
	- Everyone has doubts and insecurities—about their body, their self-worth, their sexuality.
		- IF your seduction appeals exclusively to the physical,
		    - THEN you will stir up these doubts and make your targets self-conscious.
		- Instead, lure them out of their insecurities by making them focus on something sublime and spiritual:
- (20: [[Mix Pleasure With Pain]])
	- The erotic lurks beneath the spiritual. Now your victims have been properly set up. By deliberately hurting them, instilling fears and anxieties, you will lead them to the edge of the precipice from which it will be easy to push and make them fall
	- Erotic feeling depends on the creation of tension. 




**END: They feel great tension and are yearning for relief.**



### Phase Four: Moving ln for the Kill
RECAP
1. FIRST 
	1. you worked on their mind
		1. —the mental seduction.
2. THEN
	1. you confused and stirred them up
		1. —the emotional seduction. 
3. NOW 
	1. the time has come for hand-to-hand combat
		1. —the physical seduction:

*Note pour moi: ici c'est la cerise sur le Sunday, c'est mettre un clou sur le cercueil. Donc pour l'instant gérer les autres parties PUIS celle-là.*

###### Sommaire Part 4
[[Art of seduction part 4.canvas|Art of seduction part 4]] - the physical seduction
- (21: [[Give Them Space to Fall - The Pursuer ls Pursued]]). 
	- At this point, your victims are weak and ripe with desire: by showing a little coldness or uninterest, you will spark panic
		- —they will come after you with impatience and erotic energy 
- (22: [[Use Physical Lures]]).
	- To bring them to a boil, you need to put their minds to sleep and heat up their senses.
		- It is best to lure them into lust by sending certain loaded signals that will get under their skin and spread sexual desire like a poison 
		- like sport or dancing
- (23: [[Master the Art of the Bold Move]]).
	- The moment to strike and move in for the kill is when your victim is brimming with desire, but not consciously expecting the climax to come
		- This is the time to throw aside chivalry, kindness, and coquetry and to overwhelm with a bold move.
			- The bold move should come as a pleasant surprise, but not too much of a surprise.
			- If you ever sense that the victim is expecting the bold move, take a step back, lull them into a false sense of security, then strike.
-  (24:[[Beware the After-effects]]).
	- Once the seduction is over, there is the danger that disenchantment will set in and ruin all your hard work 
		- If you are after a relationship, 
			- then you must constantly re-seduce the victim, creating tension and releasing it. 
		- If your victim is to be sacrificed, 
			- THEN it must be done swiftly and cleanly, leaving you free (*physically and psychologically*) to move on to the next victim. 
			- and the game begins all over.
