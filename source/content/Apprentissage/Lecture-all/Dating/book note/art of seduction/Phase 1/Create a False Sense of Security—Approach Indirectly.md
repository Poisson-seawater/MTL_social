[[Create a False Sense of Security—Approach Indirectly - long version]]

##### Ovide, The art of love
Many women adore the elusive, Hate overeagerness. So, play hard to get, Stop boredom developing. And don't let your entreaties Sound too confident of possession. Insinuate sex Camouflaged as friendship. I've seen ultrastubborn creatures Fooled by this gambit, the switch from companion to stud.


##### HOW 1st part of the approach: Friendship
> IF you are too direct early on, THEN you risk stirring up a resistance that will never be lowered. 

SO start to gain her attention and stir desire, then move from friendship to lover. By
1. At first there must be nothing of the seducer in your manner.
2. Use friendly conversations to [[Loi 14 -  Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy|bring you valuable information]] about
	1. their characters,
	2. their tastes,
	3. their weaknesses, 
	4. the childhood yearnings that govern their adult behavior.
3. make her comfortable with you by spending time toghether.
	1. Believing you are interested only in their thoughts, they will lower their resistance,
		1. Once  vulnerable, she has opened the golden gate to their body: her mind. 
	2. At this point any offhand comment, any slight physical contact, will spark a different thought, catch them off-guard:
		1. perhaps there could be something else between you
		2. ->Once that feeling has stirred, they will wonder why you haven't made a move, and will take the initiative themselves, enjoying the illusion that they are in control. 
			1. -> There is nothing more effective in seduction than making the seduced think that they are the ones doing the seducing.
				1. HENCE, there will be no resentment, no perverse counterreaction, no paranoia. To make them come to you requires giving them space. This can be accomplished in several ways.

###### HOW  make her seduce you - give her feeling of control
- The seduction should begin at an angle, indirectly, so that the target only gradually becomes aware of you. 
	- Haunt the periphery of your target's life:
		- letting them notice you in different places but never approaching them.
		- approach through a third party, 
		- seem to cultivate a relatively neutral relationship, 
			- -> moving gradually from friend to lover. 
	- Arrange an occasional "chance" encounter, as if you and your target were destined to become acquainted—nothing is more seductive than a sense of destiny.
- => Lull the target into feeling secure, then strike.

You can also play cat and mouse with them, first seeming interested, then stepping back—actively luring them to follow you into your web. 

> Whatever you do, you must at all cost avoid the natural tendency to crowd your targets.


##### WHAT dullness -  word and convervation
> "A woman is much better persuaded that she is loved by what she guesses than by what she is told," Ninon de l'Enclos

The dullness gives the subtlest suggestive word, the slightest look, an amplified power. 
- Never mention love and you make its absence speak volumes
	- she will wonder why you never discuss your emotions, 
		- -> HENCE, she start overthinking about you, fantasize ...
	- let her bring the topic of love or affection. 
- Deliberate dullness has many applications:
	- In psychotherapy, the doctor makes monosyllabic responses to draw patients in, making them relax and open up.
	- In international negotiations, Henry Kissinger would lull diplomats with boring details, then strike with bold demands.

###### Duke Ellington
Duke Ellington, would initially dazzle the ladies with his good looks, stylish clothing, and charisma. 
BUT once he was alone with a woman, he would take a slight step back, becoming excessively polite, making only small talk. Banal conversation can be a brilliant tactic; it hypnotizes the target.


###### WHY 
Learn to disguise your feelings and let people figure out what is happening for themselves. Never give the impression that you are angling for something—that will raise a resistance that you will never lower.
Approach people from the side. 

Mute your colors, blend in, seem unthreatening, and you will have more room to maneuver later on.

##### Symbol: The Spider's Web.
The spider threads are nearly invisible. The spider quietly sits in the corner, waiting for its victims to come to it on their own, and ensnare themselves in the web.

##### Reversal
Casanova or the siren where always moving fast. It's a question of momentum.
