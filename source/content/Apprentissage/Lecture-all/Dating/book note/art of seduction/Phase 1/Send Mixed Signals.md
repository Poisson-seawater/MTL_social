[[Send Mixed Signals - long version]]
- [ ] #_ToDo_ how to create depth -> [[_ King_Philo|#King_Philo]]

---
Once people are aware of your presence, and  vaguely intrigued THEN stir their interest before it settles on someone else.
- FIRST attract attention with what is obvious and striking, such as
	- outfit
	- suggestive glance
- ENCHAINE with ambiguity. - **MUST be done early on** - (*much more potent for long run*)
	- WHY early on: before your targets know too much and their impressions of you are see.
	- HOW
		- be hard to figure out by sending mixed signals - paradox: 
			- both tough and tender, 
			- both spiritual and earthy,
			- both innocent and cunning. 
		- Hint  contradiction within you.
- WHY: A mix of qualities suggests depth, it fascinates and confuses. 
	- make people want to know more, drawing them in -> attract their attention !!!
	- It means engaging their imaginations, making them think there is more to you than what they see. 

> Nothing can proceed in seduction unless you can attract and hold your victim's attention, your physical presence becoming a haunting mental presence.
> SO  they start embellishing your image with their fantasies, they are hooked.

###### WHAT: Regarding Paradoxe
Do not worry if this underquality is a negative one, like danger, cruelty, or amorality; people will be drawn to the enigma anyway, and pure goodness is rarely seductive.

###### Mixed signals in that first encounter, 
- to you create a little surprise, a little tension
- HOW: 
	- Exemple:
		- *you seem to be one thing (innocent, brash, intellectual, witty),* 
		- *but you also throw them a glimpse of something else (devilish, shy, spontaneous, sad).*
	- Keep things subtle: 
		- if the second quality is too strong, you will seem schizophrenic.
		- But make them wonder why you might be shy or sad underneath your brash intellectual wit, and you will have their attention. 
		- Give them an ambiguity that lets them see what they want to see, capture their imagination with little voyeuristic glimpses into your dark soul

###### To capture and hold attention - Long trun
To capture and hold attention, you need to show attributes that go against your physical appearance, creating depth and mystery. 
- If you have a sweet face and an innocent air, let out hints of something dark, even vaguely cruel in your character. 
	- It is not advertised in your words, but in your manner.
- Exemple
- The actor Errol Flynn had a boyishly angelic face and a slight air of sadness. 
	- Beneath this outward appearance, however, women could sense an underlying cruelty, a criminal streak, an exciting kind of dangerousness. 
	- This play of contrary qualities attracted obsessive interest. 
- Marilyn Monroe; had the face and voice of a little girl
	- but something sexual and naughty emanated powerfully from her as well. 
- Madame Récamier did it all with her eyes—the gaze of an angel, 
	- suddenly interrupted by something sensual and flirtatious.

To show too much desire for attention is to signal insecurity, and will often drive people away; play it too cold and disinterested, on the other hand, and no one will bother coming near. The trick is to combine the two attitudes at the same moment. It is the essence of coquetry.

##### WHY Paradox
Oscar Wilde's attractiveness was du to paradox, he consciously played up his own weirdness and ambiguity, 
- *the contrast between his mannered appearance and his witty, effortless performance.* 
- he constructed an image that ran counter to his nature. 
- THEN: People were repelled, confused, intrigued,
	- and finally drawn to this man who seemed impossible to figure out.

Paradox is seductive because it plays with meaning. We are secretly oppressed by the rationality in our lives, where everything is meant to mean something; seduction, by contrast, thrives on ambiguity, on mixed signals.
IF someone character is showy, THEN we may be momentarily attracted, but the attraction wears off; 
- BECAUSE there is no depth, no contrary motion, to pull us in. 
- HENCE: radiate mystery. 
	- no one is naturally mysterious, at least not for long; mystery is something you have to work at, a ploy on your part,
	- => must be used early on in the seduction.

###### IF No paradox
IF you display too much of one quality—even if it is a noble one, like knowledge or efficiency—and people will feel that you lack humanity; you will wear on people's nerves *(they will suspect you are a hypocrite*)
-> BECAUSE we are all complex and ambiguous, full of contradictory impulses

###### Other exemple of paradoxe
- Mahatma Gandhi, a saintly figure, openly confessed to feelings of anger and vengefulness. 
- John F. Kennedy, was a walking paradox:
	- an East Coast aristocrat with a love of the common man,
	- an obviously masculine man—a war hero—with a vulnerability you could sense underneath, an intellectual who loved popular culture

#### Symbol: The Theater Curtain.
We are draws by what's behind it —the light peeking through, the suggestion of a secret, something about to happen. You feel the thrill of a voyeur about to watch a performance.


#### Reversal
The debts is to be adapt to the victims capacity and sensitivity. 
Some people like things simple, and lack the patience to pursue a person who confuses them.

It depends on the target: 
- do not bother creating depth for people who are insensitive to it, 
- or who may even be put off or disturbed by it.
- Recognize such types by 
	- their preference for the simpler pleasures in life, 
	- their lack of patience for a more nuanced story. 
	- -> keep it simple.
