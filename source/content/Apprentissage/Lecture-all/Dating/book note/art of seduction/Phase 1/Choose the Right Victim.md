[[Choose the Right Victim - Long version]]

---

The perfect victim is the person who stirs you in a way that cannot be explained in words, whose effect on you has nothing to do with superficialities. 
- She often has a quality that you yourself lack, and may even secretly envy. 
- Test the person first.
	- It means nothing if the potential victim is not open to your influence. 
		- you cannot seduce everyone. 
		- Leave people who are inaccessible to you alone 
	- Once you feel that he or she is also vulnerable to you then the hunting can begin.
	- BUT you must actively hunt out the prey that responds the right way.

> The greatest lack of all is excitement and adventure, which is precisely what seduction offers.
> \-> Seduction is all about the challenge and adventure.  


##### Keys to seduction
###### How to recognize your victims? 
By the way they respond to you. 
- not so much attention to their conscious responses
	- AS person who is obviously trying to please or charm you is probably playing to your vanity, and wants something from you. 
- pay greater attention responses outside conscious control ([[Non Verbal - Dating.canvas|Non Verbal - Dating]])
	- a blush, an involuntary mirroring of some gesture of yours, an unusual shyness, even perhaps a flash of anger or resentment.
	- show that you are having an effect on a person who is open to your influence. 

 By the effect they are having on you. 
 - they make you uneasy perhaps they
	 - correspond to a deep-rooted childhood ideal,
	 - represent some kind of personal taboo that excites you, 
	 - or suggest the person you imagine you would be if you were the opposite sex.
 - Choose targets that inspire them but know how and when to restrain yourself. 

> To rush into the waiting arms of the first person who seems to like you is not seduction but insecurity.


Your perfect victims are often people who think you have something they don't, and who will be enchanted to have it provided for them.
- Such victims may have a temperament quite the opposite of yours, and this difference will create an exciting tension.


###### tips
Be careful with appearances. 
- The person who seems volcanically passionate is often hiding insecurity and self-involvement. -> dangerous person like Lola Montez. 
- People who are outwardly distant or shy are often better targets than extroverts. 
	- WHY: They are dying to be drawn out, and still waters run deep. 
- People with a lot of time on their hands are extremely susceptible to seduction. 
	- WHY: They have mental space for you to fill. 
- Avoid people who are preoccupied with business or work
	- WHY: seduction demands attention, and busy people have too little space in their minds for you to occupy. 

###### WHO
We 
- all want to be seduced; 
	- we yearn to be drawn out of ourselves, out of our routines and into the drama of eros. 
- And what draws us more than anything is the feeling that someone has something we don't, a quality we desire. 


Successful politicians know that not everyone will be susceptible to their charm, but if they can find a group of believers with a need to be filled, they have supporters who will stand by them no matter what. #politique/seduction


#### Symbol: Big Game.
- Lions are dangerous—to hunt them is to know the thrill of risk. 
- Leopards are clever and swift, offering the excitement of a difficult chase.

Never rush into the hunt. Know your prey and choose it carefully. Do not waste time with small game—the rabbits that back into snares, the mink that walk into a scented trap. Challenge is pleasure.
