[[Create a Need - Stir Anxiety and Discontent - Long version]]

---
> A perfectly satisfied person cannot be seduced. 

In your targets' minds, stir feelings of
- discontent,
- tension, 
- disharmony, 
- an unhappiness with their circumstances and with themselves:
	- their life lacks adventure, 
	- they have strayed from the ideals of their youth, 
	- they have become boring. 
- The feelings of inadequacy that you create will give you space to insinuate yourself, to make you as the answer to their problems.
- Pain and anxiety are the proper precursors to pleasure.
	- -> Learn to manufacture the need that you can fill.


###### FRANCESCO ALBERON - Falling in Love
The experience of falling in love originates in an extreme depression, an inability to find something that has value in everyday life.

The predisposition to fall in love is the profound sense of being worthless and of having nothing that is valuable and the shame of not having it. . . . HENCE, falling in love occurs more frequently
- among young people,,
- and people of other ages


##### HOW 
###### David Herbert Lawrence 
In almost every case the relationship
- began in friendship—with frank talks, exchanges of confidences, a spiritual bond. 
- THEN, he would suddenly turn against them, voicing harsh personal criticisms. 
	- He would know them well by that time, and the criticisms were often quite accurate, and hit a nerve. 
	- HENCE trigger confusion in his victims, and a sense of anxiety, a feeling that something was wrong with them. 
		- LOGIC: Jolted out of their usual sense of normality, they would feel divided inside. With half of their minds 
			- wondered why he was doing this, and felt he was unfair; 
			-  the other half, they believed it was all true. 
- FINALLY, in those moments of selfdoubt, they would get a letter or a visit from him in which he was his old charming self.

CONSEQUENCE, they saw him differently:
- they feel weak and vulnerable, 
- VS him who  seem so strong. 
- THEN Now he drew them to him, feelings of friendship turning into affection and desire. 
	- BECAUSE Once they felt uncertain about themselves, they were susceptible to falling in love.

###### HOW - indirect approach
It is better to stir thoughts of inadequacy and uncertainty indirectly, 
- by hinting at comparisons to yourself or to others, 
- by insinuating somehow that your victims' lives are less grand than they had imagined.

##### WHY Anxiety
You want them to feel at war with themselves, torn in two directions, and anxious about it. 
- Anxiety, a feeling of lack and need, is the precursor of all desire. 
- These jolts in the victim's mind create space for you to insinuate your poison:
	- the siren call of adventure OR fulfillment that will make them follow you into your web. 
- Without anxiety and a sense of lack there can be no seduction.

> Desire and love have for their object things or qualities which a man does not at present possess but which he lacks. —SOCRATES


###### WHY
Everyone wears a mask to show strong.
WHILE in truth, our egos and personalities are much more fragile than they appear to be; they cover up feelings of confusion and emptiness. 

As a seducer, you must never mistake a person's appearance for the reality. 
- People are always susceptible to being seduced, because in fact everyone lacks a sense of completeness, feels something missing deep inside. 
- SO Bring their doubts and anxieties to the surface and they can be led and lured to follow you. 

> No one can see you as someone to follow or fall in love with unless they first reflect on themselves somehow, and on what they are missing. 

CCL: before the seduction proceeds, you must place a mirror in front of them in which
- they glimpse that inner emptiness. 
- they are made aware of a lack, 
- SO now they can focus on you as the person who can fill that empty space: YOU


###### Remember:
Most of us are lazy. it's easier to let someone do the job of relieve us from our feelings of boredom or inadequacy, than doing it yourself,
=> The desire to have someone fill up our emptiness is the weakness on which all seducers prey. 
SO like Eros, you must create a wound in your victim,
- IF they are stuck in a rut, 
	- THEN make them feel it more deeply,
	- AND finally: "innocently" bringing it up and talking about it.
- Make people anxious about the future, 
- make them depressed, 
- make them question their identity,
- make them sense the boredom that gnaws at their life. 
- HENCE The ground is prepared. The seeds of seduction can be sown


###### On the wound:
You what you want is a wound, an insecurity you can expand a little, an anxiety that can best be relieved by involvement with another person, namely you. They must feel the wound before they fall in love.


###### HOW: seduce older people
Another devilishly seductive area to aim at is the victim's past. To grow old is to renounce or compromise youthful ideals, to become less spontaneous, less alive in a way. This knowledge lies dormant in all of us. As a seducer you must bring it to the surface, make it clear how far people have strayed from their past goals and ideals. You, in turn, present yourself as representing that ideal, as offering a chance to recapture lost youth through adventure—through seduction.
Old age is constantly seduced by youth, but first the young people must make it clear what the older ones are missing, how they have lost their ideals. Only then will they feel that the presence of the young will let them recapture that spark, the rebellious spirit that age and society have conspired to repress.


###### HOW: in politic and business
Corporations and politicians, first awaken a sense of need and discontent. Make the masses uncertain about their identity and you can help define it for them.

You can seduce an entire nation by aiming at its collective insecurity, that latent sense that not everything is what it seems. Stirring dissatisfaction with the present and reminding people about the glorious past can unsettle their sense of identity. Then you can be the one to redefine it—a grand seduction.


#### Symbol: Cupid's Arrow. 
What awakens desire in the seduced is not a soft touch or a pleasant sensation; it is a wound. The arrow creates a pain, an ache, a need for relief. Before desire there must be pain. Aim the arrow at the victim's weakest spot, creating a wound that you can open and reopen.

#### Reversal
#TOkeepSEDUCTION-Tactic 
*note pour moi: prendre la technique du nice guys E utiliser insunation*
IF you go too far in lowering the targets' self-esteem 
- THEN they may feel too insecure to enter into your seduction. 
- SO always follow up the wounding attack with a soothing gesture. Otherwise you will simply alienate them.


Charm is often a subtler and more effective route to seduction, by always making people feel better about themselves.  Deferred to them, made them the center of attention, made them feel witty and vibrant. Be a boon to their vanity, and they grew addicted to you.
- This is a kind of diffused seduction, lacking in tension and in the deep emotions that the sexual variety stirs; it bypasses people's hunger, their need for some kind of fulfillment.
- But if you are subtle and clever, it can be a way of lowering their defenses, creating an unthreatening friendship. 
	- AND Once they are under your spell in this way, you can then open the wound
