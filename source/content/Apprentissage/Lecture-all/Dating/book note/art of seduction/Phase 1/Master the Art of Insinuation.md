[[Master the Art of Insinuation - Long version]]

---

Making your targets feel dissatisfied and in need of your attention is essential, but if you are too obvious, they will see through you and grow defensive.

There is no known defense, however, against **insinuation**—*the art of planting ideas in people's minds by dropping elusive hints that take root days later, even appearing to them as their own idea*. —
- WHAT: Insinuation is the supreme means of influencing people. 
- HOW: Create a **sublanguage**
	- —*bold statements followed by retraction and apology, ambiguous comments, banal talk combined with alluring glances*—
	- that enters the target's unconscious to convey your real meaning. Make everything suggestive.

#### HOW to Insinuating Desire
In the early phases of a seduction, make everything you say and do a kind of insinuation:
- Insinuate doubt:
	- with a comment here and there about other people in the victim's life, making the victim feel vulnerable. 
- Insinuate desire by:
	- slight physical contact, 
	- a fleeting but memorable look, 
	- an unusually warm tone of voice,
	- HOW: in a brief momen
- Insinuate interest in her:
	- A passing comment to suggests that something about the victim interests you; 
		- but keep it subtle, your words revealing a possibility, creating a doubt. 

###### GOAL of insinuation
When you are not there, your targets will fantasize about the ideas you have stirred up, and brood upon the doubts. HENCE, they are slowly being led into your web, unaware that you are in control. 

###### HOW insinuation work - Freud
What distinguishes a suggestion from other kinds of psychical influence, such as a command or the giving of a piece of information or instruction, is that in the case of a suggestion an idea is aroused in another person's brain which is not examined in regard to its origin but is accepted just as though it had arisen spontaneously in that brain.

###### Keys to Seduction
WHY use insinuation
- people have their habit set, their own sets of ideas ..
- trying to persuade someone show "you are incapable of deciding—as if you knew better."
- CCL: both trigger resistance.


The way insinuation works is simple:
- Drop a hint: 
	- disguised in a banal remark or encounter,
	- it's about some emotional issue:
		- a possible pleasure not yet attained,
		- a lack of excitement in a person's life. 
- in the mind of the victime, the hint
	- is registers in the back of her mind, as a subtle stab at his or her insecurities; 
		- its source is quickly forgotten. 
	- is too subtle to be memorable at the time, later
		- , when it takes root and grows, it seems to have emerged naturally from the target's own mind, as if it was there all along. 

###### Insinuation
- lets you bypass people's natural resistance,
	- for they seem to be listening only to what has originated in themselves.
- is a language on its own, communicating directly with the unconscious. 
- a MUST tool to master !!

Since people are always reading your looks, use them to transmit the insinuating signals you choose. Finally, the reason insinuation works so well is not just that it bypasses people's natural resistance. It is also the language of pleasure. There is too little mystery in the world; too many people say exactly what they feel or want. We yearn for something enigmatic, for something to feed our fantasies. Because of the lack of suggestion and ambiguity in daily life, the person who uses them suddenly seems to have something alluring and full of promise. It is a kind of titillating game—what is this person up to? What does he or she mean? Hints, suggestions, and insinuations create a seductive atmosphere, signaling that their victim is no longer involved in the routines of daily life but has entered another realm.

###### Remember:
to sow a seductive idea you must 
- engage people's imaginations, their fantasies, their deepest yearnings. 
- suggest things that people already want to hea
	- the possibility of pleasure, wealth, health, adventure. 
- In the end, these good things turn out to be precisely what you seem to offer them. They will come to you as if on their own, unaware that you insinuated the idea in their heads.


###### Slip of the tongue
Slips of the tongue, apparently inadvertent "sleep on it" comments, alluring references, statements for which you quickly apologize—all of these have immense insinuating power. 
They get under people's skin like a poison, and take on a life of their own.

The key to succeeding with your insinuations is to make them when your targets are at their most relaxed or distracted, so that they are not aware of what is happening. Polite banter is often the perfect front for this; people are thinking about what they will say next, or are absorbed in their own thoughts. Your insinuations will barely register, which is how you want it.

###### Exemple
- Ninon de l'Enclos advised, it is better not to talk about your love for a person.
	- Let your target read it in your manner.
		- Your silence on the subject will have more insinuating power than if you had addressed it directly
	- Not only words insinuate; pay attention to gestures and looks. 

Madame Récamier's favorite technique was to keep her words banal and the look in her eyes enticing. 
- The flow of conversation would keep men from thinking too deeply about these occasional looks, 
- but they would be haunted by them. 

Lord Byron had his famous "underlook": 
- while everyone was discussing some uninteresting subject, he would seem to hang his head, but then a young woman (the target) would see him glancing upward at her, his head still tilted.
- It was a look that seemed dangerous, challenging, but also ambiguous; many women were hooked by it. 
- The face speaks its own language. We are used to trying to read people's faces, which are often better indicators of their feelings than what they say, which is so easy to control.


#### Symbol: The Seed.
The soil is carefully prepared. The seeds are planted months in advance. Once they are in the ground, no one knows what hand threw them there. Disguise your manipulations by planting seeds that take root on their own.

#### Reversal
The danger in insinuation is: 
- when you leave things ambiguous your target may misread them. 

There are moments, *particularly later on in a seduction,* when it is best to communicate your idea directly, 
- PARTICULARY once you know the target will welcome it.
