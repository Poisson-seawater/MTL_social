[[Enter Their Spirit - long version]]

---
Most people are locked in their own worlds, making them stubborn and hard to persuade. The way to lure them out of their shell and set up your seduction is to enter their spirit. 

HOW to enter their spirit:
- Play by their rules, enjoy what they enjoy, adapt yourself to their moods. 
	- In doing so you will stroke their deep-rooted narcissism and lower their defenses. 
	- WHY: Hypnotized by the mirror image you present, they will open up, becoming vulnerable to your subtle influence. 
- Soon you can shift the dynamic: 
	- once you have entered their spirit you can make them enter yours, at a point when it is too late to turn back.
	- Indulge your targets' every mood and whim, giving them nothing to react against or resist.

###### OVID, THE ART OF LOVE,
You're anxious to keep your mistress?
\Convince her she's knocked you all of a heap
\With her stunning looks. If it's purple she's wearing, praise purple; 
\When she's in a silk dress, say silk
\Suits her best of all. . . Admire 
\Her singing voice, her gestures as she dances, 
\Cry "Encore!" when she stops. You can even praise
\Her performance in bed, her talent for love-making— 
\Spell out what turned you on.
\Though she may show fiercer in action than any Medusa, 
\Her lover will always describe her as kind
\And gentle. But take care not to give yourself away while 
\Making such tongue-in-cheek compliments, don't allow
\Your expression to ruin the message. Art's most effective 
\When concealed. Detection discredits you for good.
—OVID, THE ART OF LOVE, TRANSLATED BY PETER GREEN


##### The Indulgent Strategy
-> [[The Indulgent Strategy]], exemple of Sukarno, Indonesian's dictators seductions

Entering someone's spirit is perhaps the most devilish tactic.
- It gives your victims the feeling that they are seducing you.
	- because: The fact that you are indulging them, imitating them, entering their spirit, suggests that you are under their spell.
- You are not a dangerous seducer to be wary of, but someone compliant and unthreatening. 
- The attention you pay to them is intoxicating—since you are mirroring them, everything they see and hear from you reflects their own ego and tastes.
	- -> What a boost to their vanity. 
	- When you are mirroring someone, do not stop at the person they have become; ==enter the spirit of that ideal person they wanted to be.==
- Once their defenses are down, they are open to your subtle influence.
	- slowly, take over the dance, and without even noticing the shift, they will find themselves entering your spirit. This is the endgame.

> Women are not at their ease except with those who take chances with them, and enter into their spirit.

###### Understand - frustration from stubbornness
One of the great sources of frustration in our lives is other people's stubbornness.
- How hard it is to reach them, to make them see things our way, to figure out why they act the way they do 
	- they seem to be listening to us, and apparently agreeing with us, but it is all superficial
		- —the moment we are gone, they revert to their own ideas.
- So enter their spirit, mirror them then lead the dance.

###### narcissists
All of us are narcissists.
- children narcissism was physical: 
	- we were interested in our own image, our own body, as if it were a separate being. 
- As we grow older, our narcissism grows more psychological: 
	- we become absorbed in our own tastes, opinions, experiences. 
	- Paradoxically, the way to entice people out of this shell is to become more like them, in fact a kind of mirror image of them.

###### HOW
You do not have to spend days studying their minds; simply 
- conform to their moods, adapt to their tastes, play along with whatever they send your way. 
- In doing so you will lower their natural defensiveness.
	- -> Their sense of self-esteem does not feel threatened by your strangeness or different habits.

> People truly love themselves, but what they love most of all is to see their ideas and tastes reflected in another person. This validates them. Their habitual insecurity vanishes.


###### Remember: 
the operative word is "spirit". By seeming to mirror someone's spiritual values you can seem to establish a deep-rooted harmony between the two of you, which can then be transferred to the physical plane.

Countries are like people: 
- they have vast insecurities, and they feel threatened by other customs. 
- It is often quite seductive to a people to see an outsider adopting their ways.

> When you are mirroring someone, do not stop at the person they have become; ==enter the spirit of that ideal person they wanted to be.==


#### Symbol: The Hunter's Mirror.
It's a tool to hunt a bird, that get hypnotize by the mirror.


#### Reversal: it's ony a tactic
> It is only useful in the first phase of a seduction; at some point the dynamic must be reversed.

The mirror is only a tactic to enter into somebody mind, a way to bring him or her under your spell. 
- OTHERWISE, if use to much you become a sponge, soaking up the other person's moods
	- and they will be repelled.
- SO Beneath the similarity to them that you make them see, you must have a strong underlying sense of your own identity.
- THEN, when the time comes:
	- you will want to lead them into your spirit; you cannot live on their turf.
