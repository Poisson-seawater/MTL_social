SHONAGON
A good lover will behave as
elegantly at dawn as at any
other time. He drags
himself out of bed with a
look of dismay on his face.
The lady urges him on:
"Come, my friend, it's
getting light. You don't
want anyone to find you
here." He gives a deep
sigh, as if to say that the
night has not been nearly
long enough and that it is
agony to leave. Once up,
he does not instantly pull
on his trousers. Instead he
comes close to the lady and
whispers whatever was left
unsaid during the night.
Even when he is dressed,
he still lingers, vaguely
pretending to be fastening
his sash. • Presently he
raises the lattice, and the
two lovers stand together by
the side door while he tells
her how he dreads the
coining day, which will
keep them apart; then he
slips away. The lady
watches him go, and this
moment of parting will
remain among her most
charming memories. •
Indeed, one's attachment to
a man depends largely on
the elegance of his leavetaking.
When he jumps
out of bed, scurries about
the room, tightly fastens
his trouser sash, rolls up
the sleeves of his court
cloak, overrobe, or hunting
costume, stuffs his
belongings into the breast
of his robe and then briskly
secures the outer sash—one
really begins to hate him.
