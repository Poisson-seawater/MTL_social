-> [[Recap et action - the Dandy]]

**The Dandy**: Dandies are stylish and sophisticated individuals who use their elegance and refinement to captivate others. They excel at creating a sense of exclusivity and allure, making their targets feel special and privileged to be in their presence.

They play with masculinity and femininity; they fashion their own physical image, which is always startling; they are mysterious and elusive. 
They also appeal to the narcissism of each sex: to a woman they are psychologically female, to a man they are male.

The Dandy displays a true and radical difference from other people, a difference of appearance and manner. Since most of us are secretly oppressed by our lack of freedom, we are drawn to those who are more fluid and flaunt their difference.


The Dandy has traditionally been defined by clothing, and certainly most Dandies create a unique visual style.

> The insolence of the Dandy, on the other hand, is aimed at society and its conventions. It is not a woman he cares to conquer but a whole group, an entire social world.


Dandies are masters of the art of living. They live for pleasure, not for work.


Be both masculine and feminine, impudent and charming, subtle and outrageous.
