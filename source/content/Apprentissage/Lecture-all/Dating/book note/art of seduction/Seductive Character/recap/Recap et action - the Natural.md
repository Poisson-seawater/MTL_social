-> [[the Natural]]
###### WHO
- Charly Chaplin
###### WHAT: The Lamb. 
So soft and endearing. At two days old the lamb can gambol gracefully; within a week it is playing "Follow the Leader."
Its weakness is part of its charm. The Lamb is pure innocence, so innocent we want to possess it, even devour it.


###### WHY
Childhood is like the lost paradise. 

#### HOW
- Spontaneous and uninhibited individuals who exude confidence and authenticity.
- Masters of improvisation and adaptability, effortlessly charming others with their relaxed and easygoing demeanor.

4 kind

###### the innnocent
- **primary**: weakness and misunderstanding of the world
- Innocence is weak because it is doomed to vanish in a harsh, cruel world
	- He doesn't know about good and evil. See through uncorrupted eyes
- have to elicits sympathy and the innocence must make us laught	
- communicate weakness indirectly, through looks and glances, or through the situations they get themselves into, rather than anything obvious. 
	- otherwise look pathetic.

###### The imp
- **primary:** fearlessness that we adults have lost
	- do not see the possible consequences: offend people, get hurt...
- Be brazen, blissfully uncaring, and infect them with your lighthearted spirit
	- Natural energy and spirit haven't been scolded out by the need to be polite and civil.
- Secretly, we envy them; we want to be naughty too. Adult imps are seductive because of how different they are from the rest of us
- To play the part
	- do not worry about offending people now and thenâ€”you are too lovable and inevitably they will forgive you. 
	- Don't apologize or look contrite, for that would break the spell. 
	- Whatever you say or do, keep a glint in your eye to show that you do not take anything seriously.

###### The wonder
- **primary:** have a special, inexplicable talent: a gift for music, for mathematics, for chess, for sport...
- To play the wonder you need some skill that seems easy and natural, along with the ability to improvise. 
	- If in fact your skill takes practice, you must hide this and learn to make your work appear effortless. 
	- The more you hide the sweat behind what you do, the more natural and seductive it will appear. -> [law of power appear Effortless]

###### The undefensive lover.
As people get older, they protect themselves against painful experiences by closing themselves off. The price for this is that they grow rigid, physically and mentally.
WHILE children are by nature unprotected and open to experience, and this receptiveness is extremely attractive.

Learn to not react defensively: bend instead of resist, be open to influence from others, and they will more easily fall under your spell.
