-> [[HOW - Charming mass and in politic]]
###### WHO: The Mirror.
Your spirit holds a mirror up to others. When they see you they see themselves:
- their values, 
- their tastes, 
- even their flaws.

###### WHAT
 Charm is seduction without sex. Charmers are consummate manipulators, masking their cleverness by creating a mood of pleasure and comfort.
 
###### WHY
 By adapting to their spirit and empathizing with their woes, you can make them feel bigger and better, validating their sense of self-worth. Make them the star of the show and they will become addicted to you and grow dependent on you.

Most people like to associate themselves with whatever they think elevated and cultured:
- style VS vulgarity
- charming, energetic VS boredom
###### HOW: aiming at people vanity and self-esteem

 1. deflect attention from themselves and focus it on their target. 
	 1. understand their spirit, feel their pain, adapt to their moods. 
2. In the presence of a Charmer you feel better about yourself.
	1.  Make your target the center of attention
3.  learn to listen and observe -> [[Loi 14 -  Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy]]
	1.  find —their strengths, and their **weaknesses**—
		1. then individualize your attention:
			1. appealing to their specific desires and needs, 
			2. tailoring your flatteries to their insecurities
	2. Listen to their complain THEN distract them from it by giving them pleasure (*a lot !!!*)
		1. Being lighthearted and fun is always more charming than being serious and critica
4. the more relaxed the target, the easiest:
	1. ==mirror them==, adapt to their moods.
		1. -> People are narcissists— they are drawn to those most similar to themselves. 
		2. Seem to share their values and tastes, to understand their spirit
		3. This works particularly if an outsider by showing  you share the values of your adopted group *(you have learned their language, you prefer their customs, etc.*) 
		4. Never pester or be overly persistent—these uncharming qualities will disrupt the relaxation.
5. Show calm and self-possession in the face of adversity
	1. put people at ease with your patience and confidence
	2.  Never show anger, ill temper, or vengefulness, all disruptive emotions that will make people defensive.
6. Make yourself useful: enhance the lives of others
	1. create a wide network of allies to link people together:
		1. which will make them feel that by knowing you they can make their lives easier
	2. Follow-through is key: so many people will charm by promising a person great things—a better job, a new contact, a big favor—but if they do not follow through they make enemies instead of friends
		1. Anyone can make a promise but you follow up your promise with a definite action. 
		2. Conversely, if someone does you a favor, show your gratitude concretely. In a world of bluff and smoke, real action and true helpfulness are perhaps the ultimate charm.
