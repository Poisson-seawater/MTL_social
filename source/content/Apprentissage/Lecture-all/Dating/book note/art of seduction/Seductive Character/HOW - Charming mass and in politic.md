###### HOW - Charming mass and in politic
On a mass level, make gestures of self-sacrifice (no matter how fake) to show the public that you share their pain and are working in their interest, self-interest being the public form of egotism. 


In politics, provide illusion and myth rather than reality. 
- Instead of asking people to sacrifice for the greater good, talk of grand moral issues. 
	- An appeal that makes people feel good will translate into votes and power. 
	- Bring antagonism into harmony. 
- The court is full of resentment and envy. The Charmer knows how to smooth out conflict. 
	- Never stir up antagonisms that will prove immune to your charm; in the face of those who are aggressive, retreat, let them have their little victories. 
	- Yielding and indulgence will charm the fight out of any potential enemies. 
	- Never criticize people overtly—that will make them insecure, and resistant to change. 
	- Plant ideas, insinuate suggestions.
		- Charmed by your diplomatic skills, people will not notice your growing power.

In the politics of large groups, welcome adversity as a chance to show the charming qualities of magnanimity and poise.
- Let others get flustered and upset—the contrast will redound to your favor. 
- Never whine, never complain, never try to justify yourself.
