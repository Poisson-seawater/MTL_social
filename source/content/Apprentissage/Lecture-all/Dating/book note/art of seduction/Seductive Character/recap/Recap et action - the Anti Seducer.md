>Root out anti-seductive qualities in yourself, and recognize them in others—there is no pleasure or profit in dealing with the Anti-Seducer.
>

###### WHAT
Seducers draw you in by the focused, individualized attention they pay to you. 
Anti Seducers 
- are the opposite, they literally repel by being:
	- **==insecure==**  (*the source of their repellence*)
	- self-absorbed, 
		-  at a level of self-consciousness that close them off.
	- anxious,
	- needy
	- and unable to grasp the psychology of another person,
- have no self-awareness, and never realize when they are pestering, imposing, talking too much. 
-  lack the subtlety to create the promise of pleasure that seduction requires. 

 We are able to surmount insecurity at times; 
 - a seductive engagement can bring us out of our usual self-absorption
	 - and to the degree that we seduce or are seduced, 
	 - we feel charged and confidence

###### Brute VS patience
If seduction part of the pleasure is its duration, the waiting that increases anticipation.
Brutes have no patience, they are concerned only with their own pleasure, never with yours.

VS : To be patient is to show that you are thinking of the other person, which never fails to impress. 

IF you suspect you are dealing with a Brute, do a test—make that person wait.

###### The Suffocator - deceptive
They cling to you until you are forced to pull back, whereupon they smother you with guilt. We tend to idealize a loved one, but love takes time to develop. Recognize Suffocators by how quickly they adore you.

Spot these types early on by seeing whether they are capable of having an idea of their own. An inability to disagree with you is a bad sign.


###### The Moralizer - rigid
Seduction is a game, and should be undertaken with a light heart. All is fair in love and seduction; morality never enters the picture.

These are people who follow fixed ideas and try to make you bend to their standards.

They want to change you, to make you a better person, so they endlessly criticize and judge—that is their pleasure in life.

###### The Tightwad - Cheapness
Cheapness signals more than a problem with money. It is a sign of something constricted in a person's character—something that keeps them from letting go or taking a risk

###### The Bumbler - self-conscious
Their self-consciousness heightens your own. At first you may think they are thinking about you, and so much so that it makes them awkward. In fact they are only thinking of themselves

VS boldness a key weapon of seduction.

###### The Windbag
The most effective seductions are driven by looks, indirect actions, physical lures. Too much talk will generally
- break the spell, 
- heightening surface differences 
- and weighing things down

###### The Reactor -  too sensitive
Reactors are far too sensitive, not to you but to their own egos -> vanity way.

 If you strategically back off, as you sometimes must in seduction, they will brood and lash out at you. They are prone to whining and complaining, two very anti-seductive traits. Test them by telling a gentle joke or story at their expense: we should all be able to laugh at ourselves a little, but the Reactor cannot.
###### The Vulgarian - inattentive to the details
 They do not know that it is sometimes better to control oneself and refuse to give in to one's impulses.
-> have undiscretion.

###### Use of anti seduction
To avoid them:
- Act distant and indifferent, pay no attention to them
- , make them feel how little they matter to you. 
- be anti-seductive yourself:
	- Nag; 
	- talk a lot, particularly about yourself; 
	- dress against the other person's tastes; 
	- pay no attention to detail; 
	- suffocate, 
	- and so on.
- IF a Windbag, never talk back too much. 
	- Words will only fan the flames. 
	- Adopt the Queen Victoria strategy: nod, seem to agree, then find an excuse to cut the conversation short. 
		- This is the only defense.
