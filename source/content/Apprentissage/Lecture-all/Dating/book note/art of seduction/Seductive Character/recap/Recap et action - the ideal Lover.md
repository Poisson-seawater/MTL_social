WHAT: 
> The Ideal Lover reflects your fantasy. He or she is an artist in creating the illusion you require.


The dynamics of the Ideal Lover have limitless possibilities, not all of them are erotic.


###### WHY
- We all carries an ideal either of what we would like to become, or of what we want another person to be for us.
	- if you mirror this ideal -> she fall in love

Most dreams of the youth get shattered or worn down with age. They get disappointed by people, events, reality.
Ideal Lovers thrive on people's broken dreams, which become lifelong fantasies. :
- romance? 
- Adventure? 
- Lofty spiritual communion? 

##### HOW: 
###### OBSERVE !!!
- find what is missing, her disapointment
	- Ignore her words and conscious behavior; focus on non verbal, on subtle behavior:
		- through gesture, 
		- tone of voice, 
		- a blush
		- a look in the eye or somewhere else
	- *Often the ideal is expressed in contradiction*
	- -> By seeming to be what they lack, you will fit their ideal.

###### Sex is elevated
> the ideal lover made sex seem elevated and innocent, as if it were happening in the Garden of Eden
> -> [[use Spiritual Lures]]

Ambiguityâ€”to combine the appearance of
- sensitivity to the pleasures of the flesh WITH an air of innocence, spirituality, a poetic sensibility.
