-> [[Recap et action - the ideal Lover]]
##### Intro
Most people have dreams in their youth that get shattered or worn down with age. They find themselves disappointed by people, events, reality, which cannot match their youthful ideals. Ideal Lovers thrive on people's broken dreams, which become lifelong fantasies. You long for romance? Adventure? Lofty spiritual communion? The Ideal Lover reflects your fantasy. He or she is an artist in creating the illusion you require, idealizing your portrait. In a world of disenchantment and baseness, there is limitless seductive power in following the path of the Ideal Lover.

Jeanne Poisson, Mme de Pompadour, Sergei Saltykov, and Cassanova

Rudolph Valentino, or at least the image created of him in film.
##### Casanova
Casanova was perhaps the most successful seducer in history; few women could resist him. His method was simple: on meeting a woman, he would study her, go along with her moods, find out what was missing in her life, and provide it.
In each case Casanova adapted himself to the woman's ideals, brought her fantasy to life. Once she
had fallen under his spell, a little ruse or calculation would seal the romance (a day among rats, a contrived fall from a horse, an encounter with another woman to make her jealous ...).


###### HOW to Casanova
The Ideal Lover is rare in the modern world, for the role takes effort.
You will have to focus intensely on the other person, fathom what she is missing, what he is disappointed by. People will often reveal this in subtle ways: through gesture, tone of voice, a look in the eye. By seeming to be what they lack, you will fit their ideal.

few can resist the temptation of following a person who seems so attuned to their desires, to bringing to life their fantasies.


#### Key to Character
-> [[THE PILLOW BOOK OF SEI]]
Each of us carries inside us an ideal, either of what we would like to become, or of what we want another person to be for us.
It is something we feel is missing inside us.

IF another person seems to have that ideal quality, or to have the ability to bring it out in us, we fall in love.


The key to following the path of the Ideal Lover is the ability to observe. Ignore your targets' words and conscious behavior; focus on the tone of their voice, a blush here, a look there—those signs that betray what their words won't say. Often the ideal is expressed in contradiction.

-> the ideal lover made sex seem elevated and innocent, as if it were happening in the Garden of Eden.

The key is ambiguity—to combine the appearance of sensitivity to the pleasures of the flesh with an air of innocence, spirituality, a poetic sensibility. This mix of the high and the low is immensely seductive. The dynamics of the Ideal Lover have limitless possibilities, not all of them erotic.

#### IMAGE: Portrait Painter
Under his eye, all of your physical imperfections disappear. He brings out noble qualities in you, frames you in a myth, makes you godlike, immortalizes you. For his ability to create such fantasies, he is rewarded with great power.


#### Dangers
The main dangers in the role of the Ideal Lover are the consequences that arise if you let reality creep in. You are creating a fantasy that involves an idealization of your own character. And this is a precarious task, for you are human, and imperfect.
