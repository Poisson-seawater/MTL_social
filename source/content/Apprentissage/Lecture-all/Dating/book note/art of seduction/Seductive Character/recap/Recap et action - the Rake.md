> Remember: if no resistances or obstacles face you, you must create them. No seduction can proceed without them.

###### WHO:
- like Don Juan
- D'Annunzio art of flatterie
	- charming locutions, poetic images, and a way of offering praise that could melt a woman's heart. 

###### WHAT:
The Rake's essence is that he goes further than anyone else, charming with word and offering adventure. 

###### HOW:
He is as promiscuous with words as he is with women. He chooses words for their ability to suggest, insinuate, hypnotize, elevate, infleet.

> Remember: it is the form that matters, not the content.

you must
- convey a sense of risk and darkness, suggesting to your victim that she is participating in something rare and thrilling—a chance to play out her own rakish desires.
- let yourself go, to draw a woman into the kind of purely sensual moment in which past and future lose meaning. 
	- You must be able to abandon yourself to the moment.
 - make women want to reform you.
	 -  When caught red-handed in rakishness, fall back on your weakness—your desire to change, and your inability to do so. You are the victim, you need help.
- have a reputation: Never downplay your bad name, or seem to apologize for it. Instead, embrace it, enhance it. It is what draws women to you. There are several things you must be known for:
	- your irresistible attractiveness to women;
	- your uncontrollable devotion to pleasure (this will make you seem weak, but also exciting to be around); your disdain for convention; 
	- a rebellious streak that makes you seem dangerous. 
	- *This last element can be slightly hidden*; on the surface, be polite and civil, while letting it be known that behind the scenes you are incorrigible. 
		- *Duke de Richelieu made his conquests as public as possible*.

##### WHY:
The less your targets focus on what you say, and the more on how it makes them feel, the more seductive your effect. Give your words a lofty, spiritual, literary flavor the better to insinuate desire in your unwitting victims.

Due to society and culture, woman are deeply oppressed, it remains an abiding female fantasy to meet a man who gives totally of himself, who lives for her, even if only for a while.

### DANGER

Will offend other men who will try to hurt you.
