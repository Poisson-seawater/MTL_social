[[Recap et action - the Rake]]

**The Rake**: Rakes are charismatic and adventurous individuals who thrive on excitement and novelty. They are skilled at creating a sense of mystery and intrigue, keeping their targets constantly guessing and wanting more.
- the Rake is a master of seductive language
- like Don Juan
- offer mix of danger and pleasure.

Think of Fronsac, futur Duc de Richelieu, D'Annunzio, Don Juan, Pablo Picasso

###### Take away
The Rake is as promiscuous with words as he is with women. He chooses words for their ability to suggest, insinuate, hypnotize, elevate, infleet.

> Remember: it is the form that matters, not the content.


The less your targets focus on what you say, and the more on how it makes them feel, the more seductive your effect. Give your words a lofty, spiritual, literary flavor the better to insinuate desire in your unwitting victims.


###### D'Annunzio art of flatterie
The words that voice spoke were interesting as well—alliterative phrases, charming locutions, poetic images, and a way of offering praise that could melt a woman's heart. 

###### Keys to the Character
UNDERSTAND: A woman is often deeply oppressed by the role she is expected to play She is supposed to be the tender, civilizing force in society, and to want commitment and lifelong loyalty. But often her marriages and relationships give her not romance and devotion but routine and an endlessly distracted mate. It remains an abiding female fantasy to meet a man who gives totally of himself, who lives for her, even if only for a while.

> Always remember: if you are to play the Rake, you must convey a sense of risk and darkness, suggesting to your victim that she is participating in something rare and thrilling—a chance to play out her own rakish desires.


To play the Rake, the most obvious requirement is the ability to let yourself go, to draw a woman into the kind of purely sensual moment in which past and future lose meaning. You must be able to abandon yourself to the moment.

Remember: if no resistances or obstacles face you, you must create them. No seduction can proceed without them.

The Rake's essence is that he goes further than anyone else.


the Rake's most seductive qualities is his ability to make women want to reform him.
You must exploit this tendency to the fullest. When caught red-handed in rakishness, fall back on your weakness—your desire to change, and your inability to do so. With so many women at your feet, what can you do? You are the one who is the victim. You need help. Women will jump at this opportunity;


Finally, a Rake's greatest asset is his reputation. Never downplay your bad name, or seem to apologize for it. Instead, embrace it, enhance it. It is what draws women to you.

There are several things you must be known for:
- your irresistible attractiveness to women;
- your uncontrollable devotion to pleasure (this will make you seem weak, but also exciting to be around); your disdain for convention; 
- a rebellious streak that makes you seem dangerous. 
- *This last element can be slightly hidden*; on the surface, be polite and civil, while letting it be known that behind the scenes you are incorrigible. 
	- *Duke de Richelieu made his conquests as public as possible*.


### DANGER
Will offend other men who will try to hurt you.
