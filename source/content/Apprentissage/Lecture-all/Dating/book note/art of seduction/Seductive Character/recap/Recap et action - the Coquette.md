> seduction is a process of drawing people in, making them want to pursue and possess you.

###### WHO
- Andy Warhol

Coquettes seem totally self-sufficient: they do not need you, they seem to say, and their narcissism proves devilishly attractive
###### WHAT
The Shadow. It cannot be grasped. Chase your shadow and it will flee; turn your back on it and it will follow you. It is also a person's dark side, the thing that makes them mysterious. After they have given us pleasure, the shadow of their withdrawal makes us yearn for their return, much as clouds make us yearn for the sun.


###### WHY
To delay satisfaction is the ultimate art of seduction
 - orchestrating a back-and-forth movement between hope and frustration. 
 - bait with the promise of reward — *the hope of physical pleasure, happiness  ...* —  however, proves elusive

Humans, hate a vacuum, 
- Hence IF seem distant emotional and silence  
- THEN it will make them strain to fill up the empty space with words and heat of their own.

###### HOW
> The strategy of the Coquette is never to offer total satisfaction (**mainly emotionally**). =>Imitate the alternating heat and coolness
> *it is NOT about teasing and temptation*

HOW:
- Selective withdrawal, 
	- to keep their victim off balance, surprised, intrigued. 
	- make you mysterious,
	- and we build them up in their imaginations.  
	- A bout of distancy, makes them insecure -*(perhaps they don't really like us, perhaps we have lost their interest)*.
		- **Once our vanity is at stake, we succumb to the Coquette just to prove we are still desirable.**
- Better to be ambiguous and even contradictory, frustrating at the same time that you stimulate.
