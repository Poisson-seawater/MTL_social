###### WHAT: The Lamp.
Invisible to the eye, a current flowing through a wire in a glass vessel generates a heat that turns into candescence. All we see is the glow. In the prevailing darkness, the Lamp lights the way.

> Learn to create the charismatic illusion by radiating intensity while remaining detached. It is seduction on a mass level.

###### HOW
- Purpose
	- IF people believe you have a plan, that you know where you are going (*the direction does not matter*)
		- THEN they will follow you instinctively.
	- WHY:
		- people will imagine that your confidence comes from something real
	- Purposefulness is doubly charismatic in times of trouble.
		- Since most people hesitate before taking bold action (*even when action is what is required*), single-minded self-assurance will make you the focus of attention. People will believe in you through the simple force of your character.
- Mystery
	- particular kind of mystery: the one expressed by contradiction.
		-  reveal your contradictions slowly and subtly
		- Otherwise, IF you throw them out one on top of the other, people may think you have an erratic personality
		- **Must** keep people at arm's length, to keep them from figuring you out
		- Hint of the uncanny. 
			- The appearance of prophetic or psychic gifts will add to your aura. Predict things authoritatively and people will often imagine that what you have said has come true.
	- WHY
		- most people are predictable, While contradiction make you hard to fathom, add richness to your character, make people talk about you.
- Saintliness
	- Most of us must compromise constantly to survive; saints do not. They must live out their ideals without caring about the consequences.
		- Can be done by matching political values to personal lives.
		- 1st: must already have some deeply held values;
			- that part cannot be faked, 
		- 2nd: show, as simply and subtly as possible, that you live what you believe.
		- 3rd: the appearance of being mild and unassuming can eventually turn into charisma, as long as you seem completely comfortable with it. 
- [[_ Éloquence - Voix]]: relies on the power of words
	- WHY: 
		- words are the quickest way to create emotional disturbance. 
	- it helps if the speaker is as emotional, as caught up in words, as the audience is.
	- can be learned: the devices La Pasionaria used— catchwords, slogans, rhythmic repetitions, phrases for the audience to repeat — can be acquired.
	- Roosevelt, a calm, patrician type, was able to make himself a dynamic speaker, both through his style of delivery, which was slow and hypnotic, and through his brilliant use of imagery, alliteration, and biblical rhetoric.
	- The slow, authoritative style is often more effective than passion in the long run, for it is more subtly spellbinding, and less tiring. 
- **Theatricality**: to be larger than life, to have extra presence
	-  know how to stand on a crowded stage and command attention
		- *NOTE: The effect is ruined by trying too hard*
	-  It is essential to be self-aware, to have the ability to see yourself as others see you.
	- Once you know how to command attention this way: 
		- heighten the effect by appearing in ceremonial and ritual events that are full of exciting imagery, making you look regal and godlike.
		- *note: Flamboyancy has nothing to do with charisma—it attracts the wrong kind of attention.*
- **Uninhibitedness**: 
	- Most people are repressed, and have little access to their unconscious, SO become a kind of screen on which others project their secret fantasies and longing.
	- Show that you are less inhibited than your audience—that you radiate a dangerous sexuality, have no fear of death, are delightfully spontaneous
	-  An extension of your being uninhibited is a dreamlike quality in your work and character that reveals your openness to your unconscious.
		- Its cousin is a fluidity of body and spirit; while the repressed are rigid, Charismatics have an ease and an adaptability that show their openness to experience.
- **Fervency**: You need to believe in something, and to believe in it strongly enough for it to animate all your gestures and make your eyes light up. 
	- cannot be faked
	- A prerequisite for fiery belief is some great cause to rally around—a crusade.
		- Become the rallying point for people's discontent, and show that you share none of the doubts that plague normal humans.
- **Vulnerability**: display a need for love and affection
	- Be open to the audience, and in fact feed off its energy; the audience in turn is electrified by the Charismatic, the current increasing as it passes back and forth
		- This vulnerable side to charisma softens the self-confident side, which can seem fanatical and frightening
	- WHY: 
		- This vulnerable side to charisma softens the self-confident side, which can seem fanatical and frightening.
		- charisma involves feelings akin to love, you in turn must reveal your love for your followers
	- never seem manipulative or needy. 
	- Imagine your public as a single person whom you are trying to seduce—nothing is more seductive to people than the feeling that they are desired. 
- **Adventurousness**: air of adventure and risk that attracts the bored
	- Have ==PANACHE==
	-  Show heroism
- **Magnetism**
	- If any physical attribute is crucial in seduction, it is the eyes
	- WHY
		- They reveal excitement, tension, detachment, without a word being spoken. 
		- Indirect communication is critical in seduction, and also in charisma. 
	- The eyes of the Charismatic never show fear or nerves.
