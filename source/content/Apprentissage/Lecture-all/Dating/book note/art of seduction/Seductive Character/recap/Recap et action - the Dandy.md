###### WHO
- Rodolpho Guglielmi movies
###### WHAT: Image
The Orchid. Its shape and color oddly suggest
both sexes, its odor is sweet and decadent â€”it is a tropical flower of evil. Delicate and highly cultivated, it is prized for its rarity; it is unlike any other flower.

Dandies are masters of the art of living. They live for pleasure, not for work.


###### WHY
> The insolence of the Rake is tied up with his desire to conquer a woman; he cares for nothing else. 
> VS
> The insolence of the Dandy, on the other hand, is aimed at society and its conventions. It is not a woman he cares to conquer but a whole group, an entire social world.


###### HOW
- displays a true and radical difference from other people, a difference of appearance and manner. 
	- **in a way, show Freedom**
- The Dandy has traditionally been defined by clothing, and certainly most Dandies create a unique visual style.
- play with masculinity and femininity 
	- fashion my own image -> [[Masque Date]]
- use elegance and refinement to captivate others. 
- create a sense of exclusivity and allure, making the targets feel special and privileged to be in their presence.
- Appeal to the narcissism of each sex:
	- to a woman they are psychologically female,
	- to a man they are male
