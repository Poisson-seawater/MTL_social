It can also come from your actions.\n    - The widow piqued her victim's curiosity by creating the suspense about her bedroom.\n- An element of fear—someone might find you, say—will heighten the tension.\n- Remember: you are creating a moment that must stand out from the sameness of daily life. Keeping your targets emotional will both weaken them and heighten the drama of the moment. And the best way to keep them at an emotional pitch is by infecting them with emotions of your own.\n\nAt the point of the bold move, learn to infect your target with whatever emotional mood you require, as opposed to suggesting the mood with words. You want access to the target's unconscious, which is best obtained by infecting them with emotions, bypassing their conscious ability to resist.","x":4915,"y":3089,"width":1326,"height":717,"color":"5"},
