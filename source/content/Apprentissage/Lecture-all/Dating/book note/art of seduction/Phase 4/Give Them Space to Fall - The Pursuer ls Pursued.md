[[Give Them Space to Fall - The Pursuer ls Pursued - Long version]]

----
If your targets become too used to you as the aggressor, they will give less of their own energy, and the tension will slacken.
- SO You need to wake them up, turn the tables. 
	- Once they are under your spell, take a step back and they will start to come after you
- Begin with a touch of aloofness, an unexpected nonappearance, a hint that you are growing bored. 
	- Stir the pot by seeming interested in someone else. 
	- Make none of this explicit; let them only sense it and their imagination will do the rest, creating the doubt you desire.
- Soon they will want to possess you physically, and restraint will go out the window. 
- The goal is to have them fall into your arms of their own will.
	- To Create the illusion that the seducer is being seduced.

#### Seductive Gravity push-and-pull
Step
- First, it is always best to keep at some distance from your targets. 
	- You do not have to go as far as remaining anonymous, but you do not want to be seen too often, or to be seen as intrusive. 
	- IF you are always in their face, always the aggressor, they will become used to being passive, and the tension in your seduction will flag.
	- SO Use letters to make them think about you all the time, to feed their imagination.
		- Cultivate mystery—stop them from figuring you out. 
- Then, at the point when they are ripe with desire and interest, when perhaps they are expecting you to make a move take a step back. 
	- You are unexpectedly distant, friendly but no more than that—certainly not sexual.
		- Let this sink in for a day or two. 
	- Your withdrawal will trigger anxiety; the only way to relieve this anxiety is to pursue and possess you. 
		- Step back now and you make your targets fall into your arms like ripe fruit, blind to the force of gravity that is drawing them to you. 
-  The more they participate, the more their willpower is engaged, the deeper the erotic effect. 
	- You have challenged them to use their own seductive powers on you, and when they respond, the tables will turn and they will pursue you with desperate energy.

> I retreat and thereby teach her to be victorious as she pursues me. I continually fall back, and in this backward movement I teach her to know through me all the powers of erotic love, its turbulent thoughts, its passion, what longing is, and hope, and impatient expectancy. 
> \— SØREN KIERKEGAARD

#### JEAN BAUDRILLARD, SEDUCTION,
Omissions, denials, deflections, deceptions, diversions, and humility— all aimed at provoking this second state, the secret of true seduction. Vulgar seduction might proceed by persistence, but true seduction proceeds by absence. . . . 
It is like fencing: one needs a field for the feint. 

#### Keys to Seduction 
It is only natural, in the course of seduction that your target will resist you. But once your victims overcome some of their doubts, and begin to fall under your spell, they will reach a point where they start to let go. 
- They may sense that you are leading them along, but they are enjoying it. 
- No one likes things to be complicated and difficult, and your target will expect the conclusion to come quickly. .
	- That is the point, however, where you must train yourself to hold back. 
		- Deliver the pleasurable climax they are so greedily awaiting, succumb to the natural tendency to bring the seduction to a rapid end, and you will have missed an opportunity to ratchet up the tension, to make the affair more heated. 
- After all, you don't want a passive little victim to toy with; you want the seduced to engage their will in all its force, to become active participants in the seduction. 
	- You want them to pursue you, hopelessly ensnaring themselves in your web in the process. 
		- The only way to accomplish this is to take a step back and make them anxious.
	- You have strategically retreated before ([[Poeticize Your Presence]]), but this is different. 
		- The target is falling for you now, and your retreat will lead to panicky thoughts: you are losing interest, it is somehow my fault, perhaps it is something I have done.
- Rather than think you are rejecting them on your own, your targets will want to make this interpretation, since 
	- if the cause of the problem is something they have done, they have the power to win you back by changing their behavior.
	- If you are simply rejecting them, on the other hand, they have no control. 
		- People always want to preserve hope. 
- Now they will come to you, turn aggressive, thinking that will do the trick. They will raise the erotic temperature. 
- Understand: a person's willpower is directly linked to their libido, their erotic desire. 
	- When your victims are passively waiting for you, their erotic level is low. 
	- When they turn pursuer, getting involved in the process, brimming with tension and anxiety, the temperature is raised. 
	- So raise it as high as you can.

###### HOW to withdraw
When you withdraw, make it subtle; you are instilling unease.
- Your coldness or distance should dawn on your targets when they are alone, in the form of a poisonous doubt creeping into their mind. 
- Their paranoia will become self-generating. 
- Your subtle step back will make them want to possess you, so they will willingly advance into your arms without being pushed. 
- This is different from the strategy than [[Mix Pleasure With Pain]], in which you are inflicting deep wounds, creating a pattern of pain and pleasure.
	- There the goal is to make your victims weak and dependent, here it is to make them active and aggressive. 
	- Which strategy you prefer to use (the two cannot be combined) depends on what you want and the proclivities of your victim. 

###### HOW to lure people in
Each gender has its own seductive lures, which come naturally to them. When you seem interested in someone but do not respond sexually, it is disturbing, and presents a challenge: they will find a way to seduce you. To produce this effect,
- first reveal an interest in your targets, through letters or subtle insinuation. 
- But when you are in their presence, assume a kind of sexless neutrality. 
	- Be friendly, even warm, but no more. 
	- You are pushing them into arming themselves with the seductive charms that are natural to their sex—exactly what you want. 
- In the latter stages of the seduction, let your targets feel that you are becoming interested in another person—this is another form of taking a step back. 
- Once someone has fallen for you, any physical absence will create unease. You are literally creating space. 

###### Absence
-> [[Poeticize Your Presence]]
Your absences at this latter point of the seduction should seem at least somewhat justified.
- You are insinuating not a blatant brush-off but a slight doubt: 
	- perhaps you could have found some reason to stay, 
	- perhaps you are losing interest, 
	- perhaps there is someone else. 
- In your absence, their appreciation of you will grow. 
	- They will forget your faults, forgive your sins. 
- The moment you return, they will chase after you as you desire. 
- It will be as if you had come back from the dead.

According to the psychologist Theodor Reik, we learn to love only through rejection.
- As infants, we are showered with love by our mother— we know nothing else. 
- But when we get a little older, we begin to sense that her love is not unconditional.
	- IF we do not behave, do not please her, THEN she can withdraw it. 
	- The idea that she will withdraw her affection fills us with anxiety, and, at first, with anger—we will show her, we will throw a tantrum.
	- But that never works, and we slowly realize that the only way to keep her from rejecting us again is to imitate her—to be as loving, kind, and affectionate as she is.
	- This will bond her to us in the deepest way. 
- The pattern is ingrained in us for the rest of our lives: 
	- by experiencing a rejection or a coldness, we learn to court and pursue, to love. 
	
TO Re-create this primal pattern in your seduction.
- First, shower your targets with affection. 
	- They will not be sure where this is coming from, but it is a delightful feeling, and they will never want to lose it.
- When it does go away, in your strategic step back, they will have moments of anxiety and anger, perhaps throwing a tantrum, and then the same childlike reaction:
	- the only way to win you back, to have you for sure, will be to reverse the pattern, to imitate you, to be the affectionate, giving one. 
	- It is the terror of rejection that turns the tables. 

This pattern will often repeat itself naturally in an affair or relationship. 
- One person goes cold, the other pursues, then goes cold in turn, making the first person the pursuer, and on and on.
- As a seducer, do not leave this to chance. Make it happen.
	- You are teaching the other person to become a seducer, just as the mother in her own way taught the child to return her love by turning her back. 
	- For your own sake learn to relish this reversal of roles. 
		- Do not merely play at being the pursued, but enjoy it, give in to it. 
		- The pleasure of being pursued by your victim can often surpass the thrill of the hunt. 

#### Symbol: The Pomegranate. 
Carefully cultivated and tended, the pomegranate begins to ripen. Do not gather it too early or force it off the stem—it will be hard and bitter. Let the fruit grow heavy and full of juice, then stand back— it will fall on its own.
That is when its pulp is most delicious.

#### Reversal 
There are moments when creating space and absence will blow up in your face. 
- An absence at a critical moment in the seduction can make the target lose interest in you. 
	- It also leaves too much to chance—while you are away, they could find another person, who will distract their thoughts from you.
- Use absence only when you are sure of the target's affection, and never let it go on too long. 
	- most effective later in the seduction.
- Never create too much space—don't write too rarely, don't act too cold, don't show too much interest in someone else. 
	- That is the strategy of [[Mix Pleasure With Pain]]
- Some people, too, are inveterately passive: 
	- they are waiting for you to make the bold move, and if you don't, they will think you are weak. 
		- The pleasure to be had from such a victim is less than the pleasure you will get from someone more active. Just finish and leave.
