[[Master the Art of the Bold Move - Long version]]

----
Master the Art of the Bold Move A moment has arrived: 
- your victim clearly desires you, but is not ready to admit it openly, let alone act on it. 
	- This is the time to throw aside chivalry, kindness, and coquetry and to overwhelm with a bold move. 
- Don't give the victim time to consider the consequences; create conflict, stir up tension, so that the bold move comes as a great release. 
	- Showing hesitation or awkwardness means you are thinking of yourself, as opposed to being overwhelmed by the victim's charms.
- Never hold back or meet the target halfway, under the belief that you are being correct and considerate; you must be seductive now, not political. 
	- One person must go on the offensive, and it is you.

##### The Perfect Climax 
Never underestimate the role of vanity in love and seduction. 
- If you seem impatient, champing at the bit for sex, you signal that it is all about libido, and that it has little to do with the target's own charms. 
	- That is why you must defer the climax. 
- SO A lengthier courtship will feed the target's vanity, and will make the effect of your bold move all the more powerful and enduring. 
	- the move can't be timid, otherwise it lose all it power and hurt the victime vanity.
- Once you read in your targets' gestures that they are ready and open—*a look in the eye, mirroring behavior, a strange nervousness in your presence*—you must go on the offensive,
	- make them feel that their charms have unhinged you and pushed you into the bold move. 
	- They will then have the ultimate pleasure: physical surrender and a psychological boost to their vanity. 

> The more timidity a lover shows with us the more it concerns our pride to goad him on; 
> The more respect he has for our resistance, the more respect we demand of him. 
> We would willingly say to you men: "Ah, in pity's name do not suppose us to be so very virtuous; you are forcing us to have too much of it." > —NINON DE L'ENCLOS

##### Keys to Seduction
Think of seduction as a world you enter, a world that is separate and distinct from the real world. The rules are different here; what works in daily life can have the opposite effect in seduction 
- The real world features a democratizing, leveling impulse, in which everything has to seem at least something like equal. 
	- An overt imbalance of power, an overt desire for power, will stir envy and resentment; we learn to be kind and polite, at least on the surface. 
	- Even those who have power generally try to act humble and modest—they do not want to offend. 
- In seduction, on the other hand, you can throw all of that out, revel in your dark side, inflict a little pain—in some ways be more yourself. 
	- Your naturalness in this respect will prove seductive in itself. 

We become timid, humble, overpolite, so root out all this false humility. And recapture boldness. 
- No one is born timid; timidity is a protection we develop. 
	- If we never stick our necks out, if we never try, we will never have to suffer the consequences of failure or success. 
	- If we are kind and unobtrusive, no one will be offended—in fact we will seem saintly and likable. 
	- In truth, timid people are often self-absorbed, obsessed with the way people see them, and not at all saintly.
		- And humility may have its social uses, but it is deadly in seduction
- You need to be able to play the humble saint at times; it is a mask you wear. But in seduction, take it off. 
	- Boldness is bracing, erotic, and absolutely necessary to bring the seduction to its conclusion. Done right, it tells your targets that they have made you lose your normal restraint, and gives them license to do so as well. 
	- People are yearning to have a chance to play out the repressed sides of their personality. 
- At the final stage of a seduction, boldness eliminates any awkwardness or doubts. 
	- In a dance, two people cannot lead.
	- Seduction is not egalitarian; it is not a harmonic convergence. Holding back at the end out of fear of offending, or thinking it correct to share the power, is a recipe for disaster.
- This is an arena not for politics but for pleasure. It can be by the man or woman, but a bold move is required. If you are so concerned about the other person, console yourself with the thought that the pleasure of the one who surrenders is often greater than that of the aggressor. 


###### Flynn and Tantra
Flynn later applied the principle of Tantra Sex (*the male must train himself not to ejaculate, preserving his potency and heightening both partners' pleasure in the process*) to his seductions: teaching himself to restrain his natural boldness and delay the end of the seduction as long as possible. 
-  while boldness can work wonders, uncontrollable boldness is not seductive but frightening; 
- you need to be able to turn it on and off at will, know when to use it. 
- As in Tantrism, you can create more pleasure by delaying the inevitable.


##### The bold move
The bold move should come as a pleasant surprise, but not too much of a surprise. Learn to read the signs that the target is falling for you. 
- His or her manner toward you will have changed—it will be more pliant, with more words and gestures mirroring yours—yet there will still be a touch of nervousness and uncertainty. 
- Inwardly they have given in to you, but they do not expect a bold move. This is the time to strike. 
	- If you wait too long, to the point where they consciously desire and expect you to make a move, it loses the piquancy of coming as a surprise. You want a degree of tension and ambivalence, so that the move represents a great release. Their surrender will relieve tension like a long-awaited summer storm.
- Don't plan your bold move in advance; it cannot seem calculated. 
	- Wait for the opportune moment. 
	- Be attentive to favorable circumstances. This will give you room to improvise and go with the moment, which will heighten the impression you want to create of being suddenly overwhelmed by desire. 
- If you ever sense that the victim is expecting the bold move, take a step back, lull them into a false sense of security, then strike.

###### HOW bold move
your bold move should have a theatrical quality to it. That will make it memorable, and make your aggressiveness seem pleasant part of the drama.
The theatricality can come from
- the setting—an exotic or sensual location. It can also come from your actions. 
	- The widow piqued her victim's curiosity by creating the suspense about her bedroom. 
- An element of fear—someone might find you, say—will heighten the tension. 
- Remember: you are creating a moment that must stand out from the sameness of daily life. Keeping your targets emotional will both weaken them and heighten the drama of the moment. And the best way to keep them at an emotional pitch is by infecting them with emotions of your own.

At the point of the bold move, learn to infect your target with whatever emotional mood you require, as opposed to suggesting the mood with words. You want access to the target's unconscious, which is best obtained by infecting them with emotions, bypassing their conscious ability to resist. 

#### Symbol: The Summer Storm. 
The hot days follow one another, with no end in sight. The earth is parched and dry. Then there comes a stillness in the air, thick and oppressive—the calm before the storm. Suddenly gusts of wind arrive, and flashes of lightning, exciting and frightening. Allowing no time to react or run for shelter, the rain comes, and brings with it a sense of release. At last.

#### Reversal 
If two people come together by mutual consent, that is not a seduction. There is no reversal.
