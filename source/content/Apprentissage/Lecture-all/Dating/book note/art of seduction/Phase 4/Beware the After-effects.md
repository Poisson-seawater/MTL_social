[[Beware the After-effects - Long version]]

---
Danger follows in the aftermath of a successful seduction. After emotions have reached a pitch, they often swing in the opposite direction—toward lassitude, distrust, disappointment. Beware of the long, drawn-out goodbye; insecure, the victim will cling and claw, and both sides will suffer.
- IF you are to part, THEN make the sacrifice swift and sudden.
	- IF necessary, deliberately break the spell you have created.
- If you are to stay in a relationship, THEN beware a flagging of energy, a creeping familiarity that will spoil the fantasy. 
	- IF the game is to go on, a second seduction is required. 
- Never let the other person take you for granted—use absence, create pain and conflict, to keep the seduced on tenterhooks.

##### Disenchantment 
When you seduce, you are not quite your normal self; 
- your presence is heightened, 
- you are playing more than one role, 
- you are strategically concealing your tics and insecurities. 
- You have deliberately created mystery and suspense to make the victim experience a real-life drama. 

SO Under your spell, the seduced gets to feel transported away from the world of work and responsibility.
- You will keep this going for as long as you want or can, heightening the tension, stirring the emotions, until the time finally comes to complete the seduction.

After the seduction, disenchantment almost inevitably sets in. The release of tension is followed by a letdown, can even materialize as a kind of disgust directed at you by your victim. Like a drug were wearing off. On your side, you too have idealize your targets.
HENCE, the flames will slowly die down—unless you start up a second seduction. 

There is an art to the post-seduction as well. Master the following tactics to avoid undesired aftereffects. 
- WHY: in an effort to break up, you may just revive the spell for the other person

##### Fight against inertia. 
The sense that you are trying less hard is often enough to disenchant your victims. 
- By reflecting back on the seduction, they will see you as manipulative and feel you are taking them for granted. 

After the first seduction is over, show that it isn't really over: 
- keep proving yourself, focusing your attention on them, luring them. 
	- That is often enough to keep them enchanted. 
- Fight the tendency to let things settle into comfort and routine. 
	- Stir the pot, even if that means a return to inflicting pain and pulling back. 
- Never rely on your physical charms; even beauty loses its appeal with repeated exposure. 
- Only **strategy and effort** will fight off inertia.

##### Maintain mystery.
Familiarity is the death of seduction. 
- IF the target knows everything about you, THEN the relationship gains a level of comfort but loses the elements of fantasy and anxiety. 
- Without anxiety and a touch of fear, the erotic tension is dissolved. 

Remember: reality is not seductive. Keep some dark corners in your character, flout expectations, use absences to fragment the clinging, possessive pull that allows familiarity to creep in. Maintain some mystery or be taken for granted. 


##### Maintain lightness.
Seduction is a game,. There will be a tendency in the "post" phase to take things more seriously and personally. Fight this as much as possible.
- You cannot control the other person by nagging and complaining; it will make them defensive, exacerbating the problem. 
- You will have more control if you maintain the proper spirit. 
	- Your playfulness, the little ruses you employ to please and delight them, 
	- your indulgence of their faults, will make your victims compliant and easy to handle. 

Never try to change your victims; instead, induce them to follow your lead. 

##### Avoid the slow burnout. 
Often, one person becomes disenchanted but lacks the courage to make the break.
- Instead, he or she withdraws inside, then this psychological step back may reignite the other person's desire, and a frustrating cycle begins of pursuit and retreat restart
- Once you feel disenchanted and know it is over, end it quickly, without apology. 
	- That would only insult the other person. 
	- A quick separation is often easier to get over—it is as if you had a problem being faithful, as opposed to your feeling that the seduced was no longer being desirable.

WHY: Once you are truly disenchanted, there is no going back, so don't hang on out of false pity. Be compassionate and make a clean break. 
- IF need deliberately disenchant the victim with [[the Anti-seducer|anti-seductive behavior]]. 

#### Examples of Sacrifice and Integration 
##### HOW to break up 
If a break up is too difficult, then  deliberately break the spell:
- WHY: Aloofness or anger will only stir the other person's insecurity, producing a clinging horror. 
- Instead, 
	- try suffocating them with love and attention:
		- be clinging and possessive yourself, moon over the lover's every action and character trait, create the sense that this monotonous affection will go on forever. 
	- No more mystery, no more coquetry, no more retreats—-just endless love. 
		- Few can endure such a threat. A few weeks of it and they will be gone. 

##### To seduce and keep a Queen, 
- make them see that you are not the person they thought you were. 
- Make it a delightful game to play new roles, to surprise them, to be an endless source of entertainment. 

It is almost impossible to resist a person who provides pleasure with no strings attached. SO
- When they are with you, keep the spirit light and playful. 
- Play up the parts of your character they find delightful, 
	- but never let them feel they know you too well. 
- In the end you will control the dynamic. 

##### Understand a good Break-up 
The lesson is simple:
- keep the moments after the seduction and the separation in the same key as before,
	- heightened, aesthetic, and pleasant. 

IF you do not act guilty for your feckless behavior, THEN it is hard for the other person to feel angry or resentful.
- AS Seduction is a lighthearted game, in which you invest all of your energy in the moment.

The separation should be lighthearted and stylish as well: 
- it is work, travel, some dreaded responsibility that calls you away. 
- Create a memorable experience and then move on, and your victim will most likely remember the delightful seduction, not the separation. 
- HENCE You will have made no enemies, and will have a lifelong harem of lovers to whom you can always return when you feel so inclined. 

##### fourth 
IF it is integration you are after THEN seduction must never stop. 
- Otherwise boredom will creep in. And the best way is often to inject intermittent drama. 
	- This can be painful—opening old wounds, stirring up jealousy, withdrawing a little. 
		- Do not confuse with nagging or carping criticism—those are designed to break up. 
	- On the other hand it can also be pleasant:
		- think about proving yourself all over again, paying attention to nice little details, creating new temptations. 
	- In fact you should mix the two aspects, for too much pain or pleasure will not prove seductive.
- You are not repeating the first seduction, she has already surrendered. You are simply supplying little wake-up calls that show two things:
	- You have not stopped trying, 
	- And they cannot take you for granted. 
	- The little jolt will stir up the old poison, stoke the embers, bring you temporarily back to the beginning, when your involvement had a most pleasant freshness and tension. 

Remember: comfort and security are the death of seduction. 
- A shared journey with a little bit of hardship will do more to create a deep bond than will expensive gifts and luxuries. 
- The young are right to not care about comfort in matters of love, and when you return to that sentiment, a youthful spark will reignite.

##### OVID, THE ART OF LOVE,
\ You've seen the fire that smolders
\ Down to nothing, grows a crown of pale ash
\ Over its hidden embers (yet a sprinkling of sulphur
\ Will suffice to rekindle the flame)? 
\ So with the heart. It grows torpid from lack of worry, 
\ Needs a sharp stimulus to elicit love.
\ Get her anxious about you, reheat her tepid passions, 
\ Tell her your guilty secrets, watch her blanch. 
\ Thrice fortunate that man, lucky past calculation,
\ Who can make some poor injured girl
\ Torture herself over him, lose voice, go pale, pass out when 
\ The unwelcome news reaches her. Ah, may I
\ Be the one whose hair she tears out in her fury, the one whose 
\ Soft cheeks she rips with her nails, 
\ Whom she sees, eyes glaring, through a rain of tears; without whom, 
\Try as she will, she cannot live! 
\ How long (you may ask) should you leave her lamenting her wrong? A little
\ While only, lest rage gather strength 
\ Through procrastination. By then you should have her sobbing
\ All over your chest, your arms tight around her neck. 
\ You want peace? Give her kisses, make love to the girl while she's crying—
\ That's the only way to melt her angry mood. 

##### Fifth
Remember: 
- Once you are disenchanted it is really too late.
- Otherwise it's just mean

SO, just leave
- do not bother to explain, to worry about de her feelings, to make it all soft and easy ... => simply leave 

WHY otherwise is a bad idea
- The person who seems so considerate  who mend or make excuses, is really just timid. 
- Being kind in such matters can be rather cruel. 
	- Let them put it behind and move on. 
- The death of a relationship cause your partner needless pain, AND  it will have long-term consequences for you,
	- making you more skittish in the future, and weighing you down with guilt. 
- Never feel guilty, even if you were both the seducer and the one who now feels disenchanted. It is not your fault. 
	- Nothing can last forever. 
	- You have created pleasure for your victims, stirring them out of their  rut.

Understand: The more you apologize, the more you insult their pride, stirring up negative feelings that will reverberate for years. Spare them the disingenuous explanations that only complicate matters. The victim should be sacrificed, not tortured.

##### second seduction after a break up 
It is a rare pleasure to be able to relive the past, and one's youth—to feel the old emotions.
- add a dramatic flair to your re-seduction: revive the old images, the symbols, the expressions that will stir memory. 
- THEN your targets will tend to forget the ugliness of the separation and will remember only the good things.
- You should make this second seduction bold and quick, giving your targets no time to reflect or wonder. 
	- play on the contrast to their current lover, making his or her behavior seem timid and stodgy by comparison.

Not everyone will be receptive to a re-seduction, and some moments will be inappropriate. 
- IF you want to re-seduce someone, choose one 
	- who does not know you so well, 
	- whose memories of you are cleaner, 
	- who is less suspicious by nature, 
	- and who is dissatisfied with present circumstances. 
- ALSO, you might want to let some time pass. 
	- Time will restore your luster and make your faults fade away. 
- Never see a separation or sacrifice as final. 
	- With a little drama and planning, a victim can be retaken in no time.

#### Symbol: Embers
The remains of the fire on the morning after. Left to themselves, the embers will slowly die out. Do not leave the fire to chance and to the elements. To put it out, douse it, suffocate it, give it nothing to feed on. To bring it back to life, fan it, stoke it, until it blazes anew. Only your constant attention and vigilance will keep it burning 

#### Reversal 
To keep a person enchanted, you will have to re-seduce them constantly. But you can allow a little familiarity to creep in.
- WHY: The target wants to feel that he or she is getting to know you. Too much mystery will create doubt.
	- It will also be tiring for you, who will have to sustain it.
- The point is not to remain completely unfamiliar but rather, on occasion, to jolt victims out of their complacency, surprising them as you surprised them in the past.
	- Do this right and they will have the delightful feeling that they are constantly getting to know more about you—but never too much.
