[[Use Physical Lures - Long version]]

----
Targets with active minds are dangerous: 
- if they see through your manipulations, they may suddenly develop doubts. 
- SO Put their minds gently to rest, and waken their dormant senses, by combining a nondefensive attitude with a charged sexual presence. 
	- While your cool, nonchalant air is calming their minds and lowering their inhibitions, your glances, voice, and bearing—oozing sex and desire—are getting under their skin, agitating their senses and raising their temperature. 
-  Never force the physical; instead infect your targets with heat, lure them into lust. 
	- Lead them into the moment—an intensified present in which morality, judgment, and concern for the future all melt away and the body succumbs to pleasure.

#### Raising the Temperature
###### Otero
Onstage she made every man in the audience come alive, abandoning herself in dance. In person she was cooler, or slightly so. 
- A man likes to feel that a woman is enflamed not because she has an insatiable appetite but because of him;
- SO Otero personalized her sexuality, using glances, a brushing of skin, a more languorous tone of voice, a saucy comment, to suggest that the man was heating her up.


The key to luring the target into the final act of your seduction is not to make it obvious, not to announce that you are ready. Everything should be geared, not to the conscious mind, but to the senses.
- You want your target to read cues not from your words or actions but from your body.
- You must make your body glow with desire— for the target.
	- Your desire should be read in your eyes, in a trembling in your voice, in your reaction when your bodies draw near. 
	- You cannot train your body to act this way, but [[Choose the Right Victim]] who has this effect on you, it will all flow naturally.
- During the seduction, you will have had to hold yourself back, to intrigue and frustrate the victim. 
	- You will have frustrated yourself in the process, and will already be champing at the bit. 
-  Once you sense that the target has fallen for you and cannot turn back, THEN let those frustrated desires course through your blood and warm you up. 
	- You do not need to touch your targets, or become physical. As La Belle Otero understood, sexual desire is contagious. 
	- They will catch your heat and glow in return. 
		- Let them make the first move. It will cover your tracks. 
		- BUT the second and third moves are yours. 

#### Lowering Inhibitions 
###### Flynn
Some seducers (*D. H. Lawrence* ) operate mostly on the mind, creating fascination, stirring up the need to possess them. Flynn operated on the body.
- His cool, nonchalant manner infected women, lowering their resistance. 
	- This happened almost the minute they met him, like a drug: he was at ease around women, graceful and confident. 
- They fell into this spirit, drifting along on a current he created, leaving the world and its heaviness behind—it was only you and him. 
- Then—perhaps that same day, perhaps a few weeks later—there would come a touch of his hand, a certain look, that would make them feel a tingling, a vibration, a dangerously physical excitement. 
	- They would betray that moment in their eyes, a blush, a nervous laugh, and he would swoop in for the kill. 


###### WHY
The greatest obstacle to the physical part of the seduction is the target's education, the degree to which he or she has been civilized and socialized.
- Such education conspires to constrain the body, dull the senses, fill the mind with doubts and worries.
- Flynn had the ability to return a woman to a more natural state, in which desire, pleasure, and sex had nothing negative attached to them. 
	- He lured women into adventure not with arguments but with an open, unrestrained attitude that infected their minds. 

Understand: it all starts from you. 
- When the time comes to make the seduction physical, train yourself to let go of your own inhibitions, your doubts, your lingering feelings of guilt and anxiety. 
- Your confidence and ease will have more power to intoxicate the victim than all the alcohol you could apply. 
- Exhibit a lightness of spirit—nothing bothers you, nothing daunts you, you take nothing personally. 
- You are inviting your targets to shed the burdens of civilization, to follow your lead and drift. 
- Do not talk of work, duty, marriage, the past or future. 
	- Plenty of other people will do that. 
	- Instead, offer the rare thrill of losing oneself in the moment, where the senses come dive and the mind is left behind. 

###### ERROL FLYNN: A  MEMOIR
Flynn: "I missed the mental stimulation when I was younger," he answered. "But from the time I began to have women, shall we say, on the assembly-line basis, I discovered that the only thing you need, want, or should have is the absolutely physical. Simply the physical. No mind at all. A woman's mind will get in the way." 

Earl: "Really?"

Flynn: "For me . . . I am speaking of myself. I don't speak for male humankind. I am speaking for what I've discovered or what I need: the body, the face, the physical motion, the voice, the femaleness, the female presence . . . totally that, nothing else. That's the best. There's no possessiveness in that." 

I watched him closely. 

Flynn: 
- "I'm serious," he said. 
- "That's my view and feeling. Just the elementary physical female. Nothing more than that. When you get hold of that—hang on to it, for a short while."

\—EARL CONRAD, ERROL FLYNN: A MEMOIR 

##### Keys to Seduction 
###### Understand
Now more than ever, our minds are in a state of constant distraction, barraged with endless information, pulled in every direction.
- Our discontent presents the crafty seducer with infinite opportunity. 
	- The waters around you are teeming with people seeking some kind of release from mental overstimulation. 
- The lure of unencumbered physical pleasure will make them take your bait,  but as you prowl the waters, understand: 
	- the only way to relax a distracted mind is to make it focus on one thing.
		- A hypnotist asks the patient to focus on a watch swinging back and forth. 
	- Once the patient focuses, the mind relaxes, the senses awaken, the body becomes prone to all kinds of novel sensations and suggestions. 
		- As a seducer, you are a hypnotist, and what you are making the target focus on is you.


Throughout the seductive process you have been filling the target's mind.
- Letters, mementos, shared experiences keep you constantly present, even when you are not there. 
- Now, as you shift to the physical part of the seduction, you must see your targets more often. Your attention must become more intense. 
	- Errol Flynn was a master at this game. When he honied in on a victim, he dropped everything else. The woman was made to feel that everything came second to her—his career, his friends, everything. 
	- Then he would take her on a little trip, preferably with water around. 
		- Slowly the rest of the world would fade into the background, and Flynn would take center stage. 
	- The more your targets think of you, the less they are distracted by thoughts of work and duty. 
	- When the mind focuses on one thing it relaxes, and when the mind relaxes, all the little paranoid thoughts that we are prone to—do you really like me, am I intelligent or beautiful enough, what does the future hold—vanish from the surface. 
- Remember: it all starts with you. Be undistracted, present in the moment, and the target will follow suit. 
	- The intense gaze of the hypnotist creates a similar reaction in the patient.


Once the target's overactive mind starts to slow down, their senses will come to life, and your physical lures will have double their power. 
- Now a heated glance will give them flush.
	- You will have a tendency to employ physical lures that work primarily on the eyes, the sense we most rely on in our culture. 
- Physical appearances are critical, but you are after a general agitation of the senses.
	- The senses are interconnected—an appeal to smell will trigger touch, an appeal to touch will trigger vision: casual or "accidental" contact—better a brushing of the skin than something more forceful right now—will create a jolt and activate the eyes. 
- Subtly modulate the voice, make it slower and deeper. Living senses will crowd out rational thought 

###### "the moment." 
The seducer leads the victim to a point where he reveals involuntary signs of physical excitation that can be read in various symptoms. 
- Once those signs are detected, the seducer must work quickly, applying pressure on the target to get lost in the moment—the past, the future, all moral scruples vanishing in air. 
- Once your victims lose themselves in the moment, it is all over—their mind, their conscience, no longer holds them back. 
	- The body gives in to pleasure.
	- Madame de Lursay lures Meilcour into the moment by creating a generalized disorder of the senses, rendering him incapable of thinking straight. 
- In leading your victims into the moment, remember a few things. 
	- First, disordered look (*Madame de Lursay's tousled hair, her ruffled dress*) has more effect on the senses than a neat appearance.
		- It suggests the bedroom. 
	- Second, be alert to the signs of physical excitation. 
		- Blushing, trembling of the voice, tears, unusually forceful laughter, relaxing movements of the body (*any kind of involuntary mirroring, their gestures imitating yours*), a revealing slip of the tongue
			- -> these are signs that the victim is slipping into the moment and pressure is to be applied. 

###### seduction autre 
Seduction, like warfare, is often a game of distance and closeness.
- At first you track your enemy from a distance. 
	- Your main weapons are your eyes, and a mysterious manner. *Byron had his famous underlook, Madame Mao her yearning eyes*. 
	- HOW: make the look short and to the point, then look away, like a rapier glancing the flesh. 
		- Make your eyes reveal desire, and keep the rest of the face still. (*A smile will spoil the effect.*) 
- Once the victim is heated up, you quickly bridge the distance, turning to hand-to- hand combat in which you give the enemy no room to withdraw, no time to think or to consider the position in which you have placed him or her. 
- To take the element of fear out of this, use flattery, make the target feel more masculine or feminine, praise their charms.
	- It is their fault that you have become so physical and aggressive. 
	- There is no greater physical lure than to make the target feel alluring. 
- Remember: the girdle of Aphrodite, which gave her untold seductive powers, included that of sweet flattery. 

###### Rasputin 
Shared physical activity is always an excellent lure.
- Rasputin would begin his seductions with a spiritual lure—the promise of a shared religious experience.
- But then his eyes would bore into his target at a party, and inevitably he would lead her in a dance, which would become more and more suggestive as he moved closer to her.

Hundreds of women succumbed to this technique. For Flynn it was swimming or sailing. 
- In such physical activity, the mind turns off and the body operates according to its own laws.
- The target's body will follow your lead, will mirror your moves, as far as you want it to go.

> Empty yourself of your tendency to moralize and judge. You have lured your targets into a momentary world of pleasure—soft and accommodating, all rules and taboos thrown out the window.

#### Symbol: The Raft. 
Floating out to sea, drifting with the current. Soon the shoreline disappears from sight, and the two of you are alone. The water invites you to forget all cares and worries, to submerge yourself.
Without anchor or direction, cut off from the past, you give in to the drifting sensation and slowly lose all restraint.

#### Reversal 
Some people panic when they sense they are falling into the moment. 
- Often, using spiritual lures will help disguise the increasingly physical nature of the seduction. 
	- That is how the lesbian seductress Natalie Barney operated.
		- In her heyday, at the turn of the twentieth century, lesbian sex was immensely transgressive, and women new to it often felt a sense of shame or dirtiness. 
	- SO Barney led them into the physical, but so enveloped it in poetry and mysticism that they relaxed and felt purified by the experience. 
- Today, few people feel repulsed by their sexual nature, but many are uncomfortable with their bodies.
	- A purely physical approach will frighten and disturb them.
	- Instead, make it seem a spiritual, mystical union, and they will take less notice of your physical manipulations.
