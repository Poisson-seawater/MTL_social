###### WHO
Some people refuse to grow up. Disliking responsibility, they turn everything into play and recreation. 

###### WHY
Perhaps 
- they are afraid of death or of growing old; 
- they are passionately attached to the life they led as children. 

Like all children, they are often potently narcissistic. Fun for the ride.


###### HOW
Aging Baby does not want to be involved with another Aging Baby. 
- does not want competition, but an adult figure.

Be prepared to be the responsible, staid one. 
- Appear to like the Aging Baby's youthful spirit (*it helps if you actually do*),
	- can engage with it, BUT you remain the indulgent adult.
- By being responsible you free the Baby to play. 
- Act the loving adult to the hilt, never judging or criticizing their behavior, and a strong attachment will form. 
	- ==this "acceptance" is cue to seduction in general AS a Strategy !! Sometime don't (**tactic**) for some seduction type==
