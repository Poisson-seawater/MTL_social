###### WHO
They are excited and intrigued by the exotic to the degree, that it govern all their choices in life. In truth they feel empty inside and have a strong dose of self-loathing.

They
- **do not like** wherever it is they come from, their social class (usually middle or upper), and their culture 
	- because they do not like themselves.
- **like** to travel; their houses are filled with objets from faraway places; they fetishize the music or art of this or that foreign culture. 
	- They often have a strong rebellious streak.

Do not make particularly good victims!!! They will go bored and want something else. Cause nothing, will offer true Exotic Fetishists escape from themselves.

###### Tips
One variation on this type is the man or woman who is trapped in a stultifying relationship, a banal occupation, a dead-end town. It is circumstance, as opposed to personal neurosis, that makes such people fetishize the exotic; and these Exotic Fetishists are better victims than the self-loathing kind, because you can offer them a temporary escape from whatever oppresses them. 
###### HOW
Position yourself as exotic, play it, 
- make it a kind of theater for their amusement. 
- Make a show of your difference, 
- exaggerate a little and they will imagine the rest, 
	- because such types tend to be self-deluders. 
Use
- Your clothes, 
- the things you talk about, 
- the places you take them...
