###### WHO
Cannot get out of the trap of analyzing and criticizing everything. 
- many of them feel physically inferior and compensate by lording their mental superiority over others. 
- Their conversation is often wry or ironic—you never quite know what they are saying, but you sense them looking down on you. 

###### Logic of there seduction
They would like to escape their mental prisons, they would like pure physicality, without any analysis, but they cannot get there on their own. 

Go in relationships with other professor types, or with people they treat as inferiors. But deep down they long to be overwhelmed by someone with physical presence—a Rake or a Siren, for instance.

###### HOW 
Make them feel like Don Juans or Sirens, to even the slightest degree, and they are your slaves. 
- Underneath their intellectual strength lie gnawing insecurities.
- Many of them have a masochistic streak dormant.

Offer them an escape from the mind, to make it as complete as possible: 
- if you have intellectual tendencies yourself, hide them. 
	- as it will only create competition and get their minds turning.
	- better let your Professors keep their sense of mental superiority;
		- let them judge you.
	- SO You will know what they will try to hide:
		-  that you are the one in control, for you are giving them what no one else can give them—physical stimulation.
