###### WHO
These people were the classic spoiled children, whom receive endless entertainments. Pampered Royals are taught that others will do the entertaining for them. 

Recognize these types by
- the turmoil in their past—job changes, travel, short-term relationships—
- and by the air of aristocracy, no matter their social class, that comes from once being treated like royalty.

###### WHY
Being spoiled, they get lazy, and as they get older they tend to feel quite bored and restless. So they find pleasure in variety, moving quickly from person, job, place ... before boredom sets in. 

But their ceaseless search for variety is tiring for them and comes with a price: 
- work problems, s
- trings of unsatisfying romances, 
- friends scattered across the globe.

Do not mistake their restlessness and infidelity for reality—what the Pampered Prince or Princess is really looking for is one person, that parental figure, who will give them the spoiling they crave.


###### HOW
To seduce this type: **Variety** is the key
- provide a lot of distraction—new places to visit, novel experiences, color, spectacle. 
- maintain an air of mystery, continually surprising your target with a new side to your character. 

Once Pampered Royals are hooked, things get easier for they will quickly grow dependent on you and you can put out less effort. These types make excellent victims——they will be as loyal to you as they once were to mommy or daddy. 

But you will have to do much of the work. If you are after a long relationship, disguise it. Offer long-term security to a Pampered Royal and you will induce a panicked flight.
