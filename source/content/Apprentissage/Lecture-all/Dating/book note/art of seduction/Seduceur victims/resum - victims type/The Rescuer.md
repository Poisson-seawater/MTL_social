###### WHO
They are attracted only to people with problems, the one who seem vulnerable or weak—to their sadness or depression.
Rescuers usually have complicated motives:
- they often have sensitive natures and truly want to help.
	- At the same time, solving people's problems gives them a kind of power they relish—it makes them feel superior and in control.
- perfect way to distract them from their own problems. 

Recognizable by their
- empathy—they listen well and try to get you to open up and talk. 
- have histories of relationships with dependent and troubled people.

###### HOW
If you are a woman, 
- play the damsel in distress —let act as the knight. 

If you are a man, 
- play the boy who cannot deal with this harsh world; 
- WHY: a female Rescuer will envelop you in maternal attention, 
	- + gaining for herself the added satisfaction of feeling more powerful and in control than a man. 

as a rule of thumbs:
- An air of sadness will draw them in. 
- Exaggerate your weaknesses, 
	- but not through overt words or gestures—let them sense that you have
		- had too little love,
		- had a string of bad relationships,
		- gotten a raw deal in life. 
- can invite moral rescue: you are bad, have done bad things. 
	- You need a stern yet loving hand.
	- In this case the Rescuer gets to feel morally superior, but also the vicarious thrill of involvement with someone naughty.
-  ONCE having lured your Rescuer in with the chance to help you, 
	- THEN stoke the relationship's fires with a steady supply of needs and vulnerabilities.
