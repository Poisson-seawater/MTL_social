###### WHO
What marks these types is not their love of pleasure but their overactive senses. 
 - they show this quality in their appearanceâ€”their interest in fashion, color, style.
 - or more subtle: they are so sensitive, they are often quite shy, and they will shrink from standing out or being flamboyant. 

Recognize them by how
- responsive they are to their environment, 
- they cannot stand a room without sunlight, 
	- are depressed by certain colors, or excited by certain smells. 
- They happen to live in a culture that deemphasizes sensual experience (except perhaps for the sense of sight). 

###### WHY
What the Sensualist lacks is enough sensual experiences to appreciate and relish. 

###### HOW
Aim for their senses, they can be baited with colors and smells
- take them to beautiful places, 
- pay attention to detail, 
- envelop them in spectacle, 
- and of course use plenty of physical lures.


Appeal to as many senses as possible, keeping your targets distracted and weak. You can use the same tactics again and again to keep them interested, although it is wise to vary your sensual appeals somewhat, in kind if not in quality.
