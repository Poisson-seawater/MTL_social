PERSONNAL NOTE: one of target of predilection cause can seduce with compliment on her intelligence and charactere/mind !!! 
###### WHO
From early on in life, the Beauty is gazed at by others. Their desire to look at her is the source of her power, and the source of much unhappiness:
- she worries that her powers are waning, that she is no longer attracting attention. 
- If she is honest with herself, she also senses that being worshiped only for one's appearance is monotonous and unsatisfying—and lonely. 
	- PLUS: The Beauty suffers from isolation. 
		- men are intimidated by beauty

###### WHO
Beauty is relatively easy to seduce, 
- Most important in this seduction is to validate those parts of the Beauty that no one else appreciates—her intelligence (generally higher than people imagine), her skills, her character. 
- Of course you must worship her body, mind and soul
	- you cannot stir up any insecurities on her beauty, in which she knows her strength on which she most depends
-  Intellectual stimulation will work well on the Beauty, distracting her from her doubts and insecurities, and making it seem that you value that side of her personality. 
	- Because the Beauty is always being looked at, she tends to be passive. 
	- Beneath her passivity, though, there often lies frustration: the Beauty would love to be more active and to actually do some chasing of her own. 
- A little coquettishness can work: 
	- at some point in all your worshiping, you might go a little cold, inviting her to come after you.
	- Train her to be more active and you will have an excellent victim.
- **The only downside**: that her many insecurities require constant attention and care.
