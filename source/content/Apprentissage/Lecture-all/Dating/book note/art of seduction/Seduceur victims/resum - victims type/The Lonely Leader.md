###### WHO
Powerful people are treated differently, and this has a big effect on their personalities. Everyone around them have an angle, to want something from them. 
- This makes them suspicious and distrustful,
	- and a little hard around the edges, 
- but do not mistake the appearance for the reality: 
	- Lonely Leaders long to be seduced, to have someone break through their isolation and overwhelm them.

###### HOW
Act like their equal or even their superior—the kind of treatment they never get.
IF you are blunt with them you will seem genuine, and they will be touched—you care enough to be honest (*can be dangerous tho*).

Can be made emotional by inflicting some pain, followed by tenderness.
- This is one of the hardest types to seduce, because 
	- they are suspicious 
	- their minds are burdened with cares and responsibilities. 
	- HENCE: they have less mental space for a seduction. 
- You will have to be patient and clever, slowly filling their minds with thoughts of you.
