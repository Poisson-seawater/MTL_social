###### WHO
As they get older, they hanker after their lost youth; missing their long-lost innocence, they begin to covet it in others. 

They
- have lived the good life and experienced many pleasures. 
- have, or once had, a good deal of money to finance their hedonistic lives. 

On the outside they tend to seem cynical and jaded, 
- but their worldliness often hides a sentimentality that they have struggled to repress. 
- Roués are consummate seducers, can easily be seduce by the young and innocent. 

###### HOW
 have to be young and to have retained the appearance of innocence — make a show of  how
- little experience you have in the world, 
- you still see things as a child. 

It is also good to 
- seem to resist their advances: 
	- Roués will think it lively and exciting to chase you. 
-  seem to dislike or distrust them—that will really spur them on. 
	- -> By being the one who resists, you control the dynamic. 
	- And since you have the youth that they are missing, you can maintain the upper hand and make them fall deeply in love.
	- WHY: They will often be susceptible to such a fall, because they have tamped down their own romantic tendencies for so long that when it bursts forth, they lose control. 
		- Never give in too early, and never let your guard down—such types can be dangerous.
