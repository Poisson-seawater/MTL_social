###### WHO
Sexual prudery still exists, but it is less common.

Prudery, is never just about sex; it is someone
- who is excessively concerned with
	- appearances, 
	- what society considers appropriate and acceptable behavior.
- who stay within the boundaries of correctness out of fear of society's judgment. 
- who is excessively concerned with standards of 
	- goodness, 
	- fairness, 
	- political sensitivity, 
	- tastefulness,
	- etc. 

###### WHY
What marks the New Prude, is deep down they are actually excited and intrigued by guilty, transgressive pleasures. Frightened by this attraction, they run in the opposite direction and become the most correct of all. 

They 
- tend to wear drab colors; they never take fashion risks.
- can be very judgmental and critical of people who do take risks and are less correct. 
- are also addicted to routine, which gives them a way to tamp down their inner turmoil. 
- are secretly oppressed by their correctness and long to transgress. 

###### HOW
They are Prime targets for a Rake or Siren, as they are tempted by someone dangerous or naughty side.
- Do not be taken in by their judgments of you or their criticisms.
	- Sign of how deeply you fascinate them; you are on their mind.
- Seduce, by giving them the chance to criticize you or even try to reform you. 
	- Take nothing of what they say to heart,
	- and NOW you have the perfect excuse to spend time with them
		- New Prudes can be seduced simply through being in contact with you.
