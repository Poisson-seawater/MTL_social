###### WHO
Were once happy-go-lucky seducers who had their way with the opposite sex. 
- But  they were forced to give this up.
- AND they feel some resentment and a sense of loss, as if a limb were missing. 

###### HOW
It is critical, though, to give these types the illusion that they are the ones doing the seducing.

With the Reformed Rake,
- you must spark his interest indirectly, then let him burn and glow with desire. 

With the Reformed Siren, 
- you want to give her the impression that she still has the irresistible power to draw a man in and make him give up everything for her. 

###### WHY
We are always trying to recapture pleasures we experienced in the past, for Reformed Rake or Siren  the pleasures they found in seduction were intense.
- These types are ripe for the picking: all that is required is that you cross their path and offer them the opportunity to resume.
- Their blood will stir and the call of their youth will overwhelm them.

###### WHAT
Remember that what you are offering these types is the chance to escape the corral and have some ran.
- Do not be put off if they are in a relationship; a preexisting commitment is often the perfect foil.
