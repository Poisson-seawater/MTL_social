###### WHO
You will not always recognize Conquerors by their exterior—they can seem a little shy in social situations and can have a degree of reserve. Look not at their words or appearance but at their actions, in work and in relationships. 
They
- have an unusual amount of energy, 
	- which they find difficult to control. 
- are always on the prowl for people to conquer, obstacles to surmount.
- love power, 
	- and by hook or by crook they get it.
- tend to be emotional, 
	- but their emotion only comes out in outbursts, when pushed. 


###### HOW
In matters of romance, 
- **NEVER**: lie down and make yourself easy prey; they may take advantage of your weakness, 
	- they will discard you
- give them a chance to be aggressive, to overcome some resistance or obstacle, give them a good chase
	- Being a little difficult or moody, using coquetry, will often do the trick.
	- THEN let them think they have overwhelmed you. 
- Do not be intimidated by their aggressiveness and energy—that is precisely what you can turn to your advantage.
	- To break them in, keep them charging back and forth like a bull. Eventually they will grow weak and dependent.
