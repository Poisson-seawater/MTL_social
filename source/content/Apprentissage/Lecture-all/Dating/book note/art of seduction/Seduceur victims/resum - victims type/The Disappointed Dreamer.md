###### WHO et WHY
As children, who spent a lot of time alone. To entertain themselves they developed a powerful fantasy life, fed by books and films and other kinds of popular culture. 
And as they get older, they gey disappointed by what they get. 

This is particularly true in relationships, as the years pass, they force themselves to compromise, otherwise they would end up alone; 
- -> beneath the surface they are bitter and still hungering for something grand and romantic.

Recognize this type by
- the books and films they go to, 
- the way their ears prick up when told of the real-life adventures.
- In their clothes and home furnishings, a taste for exuberant romance or drama will peek through. 

They are often trapped in drab relationships, and little comments here and there will reveal their disappointment and inner tension.

###### HOW:
- have a great deal of pent-up passion and energy, which you can release and focus on yourself.
- have great imaginations and will respond to anything vaguely mysterious or romantic that you offer them.
	- All you need do is disguise some of your less than exalted qualities and give them a part of their dream.
	- This could be the chance to live out their adventures or be courted by a chivalrous soul
- Give them a part of what they want they will imagine the rest. 
	- At all cost, do not let reality break the illusion you are creating. One moment of pettiness and they will be gone, more bitterly disappointed than ever.
