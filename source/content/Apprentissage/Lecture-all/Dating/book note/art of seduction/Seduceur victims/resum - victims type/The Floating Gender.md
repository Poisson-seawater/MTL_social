###### The Floating Gender
All of us have a mix of the masculine and the feminine in our characters, but most of us learn to develop and exhibit the socially acceptable side while repressing the other. People of the Floating Gender type feel that the separation of the sexes into such distinct genders is a burden. 
They are sometimes thought to be repressed or latent homosexuals, but this is a misunderstanding: they may well be heterosexual but their masculine and feminine sides are in flux, and because this may discomfit others if they show it, they learn to repress it, perhaps by going to one extreme. They would actually love to be able to play with their gender, to give full expression to both sides. Many people fall into this type without its being obvious: a woman may have a masculine energy, a man a developed aesthetic side. Do not look for obvious signs, because these types often go underground, keeping it under wraps. This makes them vulnerable to a powerful seduction. 

What Floating Gender types are really looking for is another person of uncertain gender, their counterpart from the opposite sex. Show them that in your presence and they can relax, express the repressed side of their character. 
IF you have such proclivities,
- THEN this is the one instance where it would be best to seduce the same type of the opposite sex. 
- AS Each person will stir up repressed desires in the other and will suddenly have license to explore all kinds of gender combinations, without fear of judgment.

IF you are not of the Floating Gender,
- THEN leave this type alone. You will only inhibit them and create more discomfort.
