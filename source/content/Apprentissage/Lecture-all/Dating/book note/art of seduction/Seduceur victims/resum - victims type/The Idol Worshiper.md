###### WHO
Idol Worshipers have a bigger emptiness - an inner lack - than most people. They cannot be satisfied with themselves, so they search the world for something to worship, something to fill their inner void.

This often assumes the form of a great interest in spiritual matters or in some worthwhile cause; by focusing on something supposedly elevated, they distract themselves from their own void, from what they dislike about themselves.
Short terme only

Easy to spot—they are the ones pouring their energies into some cause or religion. Often moving around over the years, leaving one cult for another.


###### HOW
Become their object of worship, take the place of the cause or religion
- **1st**: (*seem to*) share their spiritual interest,
	- joining them in their worship, 
		- or perhaps exposing them to a new cause; 
	- THEN you will displace it. 
		- Keep everything on an elevated plane—let romance and religion flow into one. 
- Hide your flaws, or at least to give them a saintly sheen.
	- Be banal and Idol Worshipers will pass you by.
	- But mirror the qualities they aspire to have for themselves and they will slowly transfer their adoration to you. 

Keep two things in mind when seducing this type:
1. they tend to have overactive minds, which can make them quite suspicious.
	1. WHY: they often lack physical stimulation, and because physical stimulation will distract them, 
		1. SO: give them some: a mountain trek, a boat trip, or sex will do the trick.
		2. But this takes a lot of work, for their minds are always ticking. 
	2. they suffer from low self-esteem. 
		1. Do not try to raise it; 
			1. they will see through you, and your efforts at praising them will clash with their own self-image.
		2. WHY: They are to worship you; you are not to worship them.
