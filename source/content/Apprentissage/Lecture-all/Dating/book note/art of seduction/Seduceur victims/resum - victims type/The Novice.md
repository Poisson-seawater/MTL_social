###### Recap 
Novices VS ordinary innocent young people are fatally curious. They have no experience of the world, only been exposed to it secondhand—in newspapers, films, books...

They long to be initiated into the ways of the world.
- Everyone sees them as so sweet and innocent, but they know this isn't so—they cannot be as angelic as people think them. 

Seducing a Novice is easy but requires a bit of art. Novices are interested in people with experience, particularly people with a touch of corruption and evil.
- Make that touch too strong, and it will intimidate and frighten them. 
- What works best with a Novice is a mix of qualities. 
	- You are somewhat childlike yourself, with a playful spirit. 
	- At the same time, it is clear that you have hidden depths, even sinister ones. 

You are initiating your Novices not just sexually but experientially
- ,exposing them to new ideas,
- taking them to new places,
- new worlds both literal and metaphoric. 
- Being romantic, can even include a bit of the evil and dark side of life.

Young people have their ideals; it is best to initiate them with an aesthetic touch. 
- Seductive language works wonders
- Spectacles and colorful events 

=> They are easily misled by these tactics, because they lack the experience to see through them. 

BE AWARE: Sometimes Novices are a little older and have been at least somewhat educated in the ways of the world. Yet they put on a show of innocence, for they see the power it has over older people. 
But the way to seduce them is pretty much the same—mix innocence and corruption and you will fascinate them.
