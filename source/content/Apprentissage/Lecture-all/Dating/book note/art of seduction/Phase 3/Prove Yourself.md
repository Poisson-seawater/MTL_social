[[Prove Yourself - long version]]

----


Most people want to be seduced. If they resist your efforts, it is probably because you have not gone far enough to allay their doubts—about your motives, the depth of your feelings, and so on. 

One well-timed action that shows how far you are willing to go to win them over will dispel their doubts. 
- Do not worry about looking foolish or making a mistake—any kind of deed that is self-sacrificing and for your targets' sake will so overwhelm their emotions, they won't notice anything else. 
- Never appear discouraged by people's resistance, or complain. 
	- Instead, meet the challenge by doing something extreme or chivalrous. 
- Conversely, spur others to prove themselves by making yourself hard to reach, unattainable, worth fighting over.

##### Seductive Evidence
Anyone can talk big. But if they never behave in a way that will back up their words, we begin to doubt their sincerity. Flattery and fine words can only go so far. A time will arrive when you will have to match your words with deeds. This kind of evidence has two functions. 
- First, it allays any lingering doubts about you. 
- Second, an action that reveals some positive quality in you is immensely seductive in and of itself. 
	- Brave or selfless deeds create a powerful and positive emotional reaction.
	- Don't worry, your deeds do not have to be so brave and selfless that you lose everything in the process. The appearance alone of nobility will often suffice.
	- In fact, in a world where people overanalyze and talk too much, any kind of action has a bracing, seductive effect.

###### Resistance
It is normal in the course of a seduction to encounter resistance. But many a seduction fails because the seducer does not correctly read the resistances of the target. More often than not, you give up too easily. 
- First, understand a primary law of seduction:
	- resistance is a sign that the other person's emotions are engaged in the process. 
		- The only person you cannot seduce is somebody distant and cold. 
- Resistance is emotional, and can be transformed into its opposite, much as, in jujitsu, the physical resistance of an opponent can be used to make him fall. 
	- As the great seductress Natalie Barney once wrote, "Most virtue is a demand for greater seduction."
- IF people resist you because they don't trust you,
	- THEN an apparently selfless deed, showing how far you are willing to go to prove yourself, is a powerful remedy. 
- IF they resist because they are virtuous, or because they are loyal to someone else, all the better—virtue and repressed desire are easily overcome by action.

###### HOW prove yourself
**First**, the spontaneous action: 
- a situation arises in which the target needs help, a problem needs solving, or, simply, he or she needs a favor. 
	- You cannot foresee these situations, but you must be ready for them, for they can spring up at any time. 
- Impress the target by going further than really necessary—sacrificing more money, more time, more effort than they had expected.
- Your target will often use these moments, or even manufacture them, as a kind of test: 
	- will you retreat? Or will you rise to the occasion?
	- You cannot hesitate or flinch, even for a moment, or all is lost.
- IF necessary, make the deed seem to have cost you more than it has, never with words, but indirectly—exhausted looks, reports spread through a third party, whatever it takes.


**The second way** is the brave deed that you plan and execute in advance, on your own and at the right moment—preferably some way into the seduction, when any doubts the victim still has about you are more dangerous than earlier on. 
- Choose a dramatic, difficult action that reveals the painful time and effort involved. 
	- Danger can be extremely seductive. 
- Cleverly lead your victim into a crisis, a moment of danger, or indirectly put them in an uncomfortable position, and you can play the rescuer, the gallant knight. 
- The powerful feelings and emotions this elicits can easily be redirected into love.

When dealing with difficult or resistant targets, it is usually best to improvise:
- IF your action seems sudden and a surprise,
	- THEN it will make them more emotional, loosen them up.
- A little roundabout accumulation of information—a little spying—is always a good idea. 
- Most important is the spirit in which you enact your proof.
	- IF you are lighthearted and playful, if you make the target laugh, proving yourself and amusing them at the same time, THEN it won't matter if you mess up, or if they see you have employed a little trickery.
		- They will give in to the pleasant mood you have created. 
		- Never whined or grew angry or defensive.


Most people are insecure and doubts like these can ruin the seductive illusion.
- If she is gorgeous, she know well enough she is being used too, and may grow cynical.
	- But people often use cynicism to cover up insecurity. 
	- Pauline (Bonapart)'s secret anxiety was that none of her lovers had ever really loved her—that all of them to a man had really just wanted sex or political favors from her. 


Making your deed as dashing and chivalrous as possible will elevate the seduction to a new level, stir up deep emotions, and conceal any ulterior motives you may have. 
- The sacrifices you are making must be visible; 
	- talking about them, or explaining what they have cost you, will seem like bragging. 
- INSTEAD Lose sleep, fall ill, lose valuable time, put your career on the line, spend more money than you can afford.
	- You can exaggerate all this for effect, but don't get caught boasting about it or feeling sorry for yourself: cause yourself pain and let them see it. 
-  Since almost everyone else in the world seems to have an angle, your noble and selfless deed will be irresistible.


The appeal of seduction is that of being separated from our normal routines, experiencing the thrill of the unknown. Death is the ultimate unknown. There is something immensely seductive about danger, about heading into the unknown.
- Show that you have a reckless streak and a daring nature, that you lack the usual fear of death, and you are instantly fascinating to the bulk of humanity. 
- What you are proving in this instance is not how you feel toward another person but something about yourself: 
	- you are willing to go out on a limb.
		- You are not just another talker and braggart.
	- It is a recipe for instant charisma.
		- You do not necessarily have to risk death, but putting yourself in its vicinity will give you a seductive charge. (*It is often best to do this some way into the seduction, making it come as a pleasant surprise.*) 
	- You are willing to enter the unknown. 
		- No one is more seductive than the person who has had a brush with death. 
		- People will be drawn to you; perhaps they are hoping that some of your adventurous spirit will rub off on them.


The opportunity to do your selfless deed often comes upon you suddenly. You have to show your worth in an instant, right there on the spot. It could be a rescue situation, a gift you could make or a favor you could do, a sudden request to drop everything and come to their aid. 
- What matters most is not whether you act rashly, make a mistake, and do something foolish, 
	- BUT that you seem to act on their behalf without thought for yourself or the consequences.
	- At moments like these, hesitation, even for a few seconds, can ruin all the hard work of your seduction, revealing you as self-absorbed, unchivalrous, and cowardly. 
- Remember: not only what you do matters, but how you do it.
	- IF you are naturally self-absorbed, learn to disguise it. 
		- React as spontaneously as possible, exaggerating the effect by seeming flustered, overexcited, even foolish—love has driven you to that point.
	- IF you have to jump into the cart for Guinevere's sake, make sure she sees that you do it without the slightest hesitation.

##### ANDREAS CAPELLANUS, On Love
The man says:
- " . . . A fruit picked from one's own orchard ought to taste sweeter than one obtained from a stranger's tree, and what has been attained by greater effort is cherished more dearly than what is gained with little trouble.
- As the proverb says: 'Prizes great cannot be won unless some heavy labor's done.'" 

The woman says: 
- "If no great prizes can be won unless some heavy labor's done, you must suffer the exhaustion of many toils to be able to attain the favors you seek, since what you ask for is a greater prize." 

The man says:
- "I give you all the thanks that I can express for so sagely promising me your love when I have performed great toils. God forbid that I or any other could win the love of so worthy a woman without first attaining it by many labors."

—ANDREAS CAPELLANUS ON LOVE, TRANSLATED BY P. G. WALSH


###### Remember
Make people compete for your attention, make them prove themselves in some way, and you will find them rising to the challenge. The heat of seduction is raised by such challenges—show me that you really love me. When one person (of either sex) rises to the occasion, often the other person is now expected to do the same, and the seduction heightens. By making people prove themselves, too, you raise your value and cover up your defects. Your targets are too busy trying to prove themselves to notice your blemishes and faults.

#### Symbol: The Tournament.
The lady looks on as knights fight for her hand. She has heard them declare love on bended knee, their endless songs and pretty promises. 
In the tournament there can be no faking or hesitation. The knight she chooses must have blood on his face, and a few broken limbs.

#### Reversal
When trying to prove that you are worthy of your target, remember that every target sees things differently.
Seducers must adapt their way of proving themselves to the doubts and weaknesses of the seduced. For some, fine words are better proofs than daredevil deeds, particularly if they are written down, use a letter—a different kind of physical proof, and one with more poetic appeal than some showy bit of action. 

=> Know your target well, and aim your seductive evidence at the source of their doubts or resistance.
