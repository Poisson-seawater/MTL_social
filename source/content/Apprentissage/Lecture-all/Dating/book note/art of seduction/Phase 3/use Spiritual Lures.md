Art of Seduction: "[[_ Art of Seduction]]"
---
[[use Spiritual Lures - Long version]]

----
Everyone has doubts and insecurities—about their body, their self-worth, their sexuality. 
- IF your seduction appeals exclusively to the physical, 
	- THEN you will stir up these doubts and make your targets self-conscious. 
- Instead, lure them out of their insecurities by making them focus on something sublime and spiritual: 
	- a religious experience, a lofty work of art, the occult. 
- Play up your divine qualities; affect an air of discontent with worldly things; speak of the stars, destiny, the hidden threads that unite you and the object of the seduction. 
	- Lost in a spiritual mist, the target will feel light and uninhibited. 
	- Deepen the effect of your seduction by making its sexual culmination seem like the spiritual union of two souls.

##### Object of Worship
Natalie Barney, was buoyant, lighthearted, absorbed in the world around her. 
- She took the victim outside herself, directing her attention toward beauty, poetry, the innocence of Sapphic love. 
- She invited her women to participate in a kind of cult in which they would worship these sublimities. 
	- To heighten the cultlike feeling, she involved them in little rituals: they would call each other by new names, send each other poems in daily telegrams, wear costumes, make pilgrimages to holy sites.

Two things would inevitably happen:
- the women would start to direct some of the worshipful feelings they were experiencing toward Natalie, who seemed as lofty and beautiful as the things she held up to be adored; 
- and, pleasantly diverted into this spiritualized realm, they would also lose any heaviness they had felt about their bodies, their selves, their identities. 
	- Their repression of their sexuality would melt away. By the time Natalie kissed or caressed them, it would feel like something innocent, pure, as if they had returned to the Garden of Eden before the fall.


As we contemplate the object of worship (God, nature), our burdens are lifted away, we feel connects us to something larger. 
- No matter how progressive the times, many of us feel uncomfortable with our bodies, our animal drives. 
	- HENCE A seducer who focuses too much attention on the physical will stir up self-consciousness, and a residue of disgust. 
- So focus attention on something else.
	- Invite the other person to worship something beautiful in the world. It could be nature, a work of art, even God (or gods—paganism never goes out of fashion); people are dying to believe in something.
	- Add some rituals. If you can make yourself seem to resemble the thing you are worshiping—you are natural, aesthetic, noble, and sublime—your targets will transfer their worship to you.

Religion and spirituality are full of sexual undertones that can be brought to the surface once you have made your targets lose their self-awareness. From spiritual ecstasy to sexual ecstasy is but one small step.

> Come back to take me, quickly, and lead me far away. Purify me with a great fire of divine love, none of the animal kind. You are all soul when you want to be, when you feel it, take me far away from my body.
> \—LIANE DE POUGY

#### Keys to Seduction
###### religion
Religion is the most seductive system that mankind has created. Death is our greatest fear, and religion offers us the illusion that we are immortal, that something about us will live on.
The idea that we are an infinitesimal part of a vast and indifferent universe is terrifying; religion humanizes this universe, makes us feel important and loved. 
- We too can be sublime, rational, and good. 
- Anything that feeds a desire or a wished-for illusion is seductive, and nothing can match religion in this arena. 

Pleasure is the bait that you use to lure a person into your web. But no matter how clever a seducer you are, in the back of your targets' mind they are aware of the endgame, the physical conclusion toward which you are heading. You may think your target is unrepressed and hungry for pleasure, but almost all of us are plagued by an underlying unease with our animal nature. Unless you deal with this unease, your seduction, even when successful in the short term, will be superficial and temporary.

###### Natalie Barney
Natalie Barney, try to capture her target's soul, to build the foundation of a deep and lasting seduction. 
- Lure the victim deep into your web with spirituality, making physical pleasure seem sublime and transcendent. 
- Spirituality will disguise your manipulations, suggesting that your relationship is timeless, and creating a space for ecstasy in the victim's mind. 
- Remember that seduction is a mental process, and nothing is more mentally intoxicating than religion, spirituality, and the occult.

###### Madame Bovary
In Gustave Flaubert's novel Madame Bovary, Rodolphe Boulanger strategy is threefold. 
- First he talks of sadness, melancholy, discontent, talk that makes him seem nobler than other people, as if life's common material pursuits could not satisfy him. 
- Next he talks of destiny, the magnetic attraction of two souls. This makes his interest in Emma seem not so much a momentary impulse as something timeless, linked to the movement of the stars. 
- Finally he talks of angels, the elevated and the sublime. By placing everything on the spiritual plane, he distracts Emma from the physical, makes her feel giddy, and packs a seduction that could have taken months into a matter of a few encounters.

The references Rodolphe uses might seem cliched by today's standards, but the strategy itself will never grow old. Simply adapt it to the occult fads of the day. 
- Affect a spiritual air by displaying a discontent with the banalities of life.
	- It is not money or sex or success that moves you; your drives are never so base.
- No, something much deeper motivates you. 
	- Whatever this is, keep it vague, letting the target imagine your hidden depths. 
- The stars, astrology, fate, are always appealing; create the sense that destiny has brought you and your target together. 
	- That will make your seduction feel more natural.
	- In a world where too much is controlled and manufactured, the sense that fate, necessity, or some higher power is guiding your relationship is doubly seductive. 
- If you want to weave religious motifs into your seduction, it is always best to choose some distant, exotic religion with a slightly pagan air. 
	- It is easy to move from pagan spirituality to pagan earthiness. 
- Timing counts: once you have stirred your targets' souls, move quickly to the physical, making sexuality seem merely an extension of the spiritual vibrations you are experiencing. 
	- In other words, employ the spiritual strategy as close to the time for your bold move as possible.

###### Modern word
In the modern world, culture and art have in some ways taken the place of religion. There are two ways to use art in your seduction: 
- first, create it yourself, in the target's honor. Natalie Barney wrote poems, and barraged her targets with them.
	- Half of Picasso's appeal to many women was the hope that he would immortalize them in his paintings—for Ars longa, vita brevis (Art is long, life is short), as they used to say in Rome. 
	- Even if your love is a passing fancy, by capturing it in a work of art you give it a seductive illusion of eternity. 
- The second way to use art is to make it ennoble the affair, giving your seduction an elevated edge. 
	- Natalie Barney took her targets to the theater, to the opera, to museums, to places full of history and atmosphere. 
	- In such places your souls can vibrate to the same spiritual wavelength. Of course you should avoid works of art that are earthy or vulgar, calling attention to your intentions. 
	- The play, movie, or book can be contemporary, even a little raw, as long as it contains a noble message and is tied to some just cause.
	- Even a political movement can be spiritually uplifting.
- Remember to tailor your spiritual lures to the target. 
	- If the target is earthy and cynical, paganism or art will be more productive than the occult or religious piety.


###### Rasputin
The Russian mystic Rasputin was revered for his saintliness and his healing powers. Women in particular were fascinated with Rasputin and would visit him in his St. Petersburg apartment for spiritual guidance.
- He would talk to them of the simple goodness of the Russian peasantry, God's forgiveness, and other lofty matters.
- But after a few minutes of this, he would inject a comment or two that were of a much different nature—something about the woman's beauty, her lips that were so inviting, the desires she could inspire in a man. 
- He would talk of different kinds of love—love of God, love between friends, love between a man and a woman—but mix them all up as if they were one. 
- Then as he returned to discussing spiritual matters, he would suddenly take the woman's hand, or whisper into her ear. All this would have an intoxicating effect—women would find themselves dragged into a kind of maelstrom, both spiritually uplifted and sexually excited. 
- Hundreds of women succumbed during these spiritual visits, for he would also tell them that they could not repent until they had sinned, and who better to sin with than Rasputin.

###### recap
There is no more seductive brew than the combination of the spiritual and the sexual, the high and the low. 
- When you talk of spiritual matters, then, let your looks and physical presence hint of sexuality at the same time. 
- Make the harmony of the universe and union with God seem to confuse with physical harmony and the union between two people. 
- IF you can make the endgame of your seduction appear as a spiritual experience, you will heighten the physical pleasure and create a seduction with a deep and lasting effect.

#### Symbol: The Stars in the sky. 
Objects of worship for centuries, and symbols of the sublime and divine. In contemplating them, we are momentarily distracted from everything mundane and mortal. We feel lightness. 
Lift your targets' minds up to the stars and they will not notice what is happening here on earth.

#### Reversal
Letting your targets feel that your affection is neither temporary nor superficial will often make them fall deeper under your spell. 

In some, though, it can arouse an anxiety:
- the fear of commitment, of a claustrophobic relationship with no exits. 
- SO Never let your spiritual lures seem to be leading in that direction, then.
	- To focus attention on the distant future may implicitly constrict their freedom; you should be seducing them, not offering to marry them. 
	- What you want is to make them lose themselves in the moment, experiencing the timeless depth of your feelings in the present tense. 
	- -> Religious ecstasy is about intensity, not temporal extensity.
