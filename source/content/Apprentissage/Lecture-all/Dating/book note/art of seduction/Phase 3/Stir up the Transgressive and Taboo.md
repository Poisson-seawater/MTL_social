[[Stir up the Transgressive and Taboo - Long]]

---

There are always social limits on what one can do. Some of these, the most elemental taboos, go back centuries; others are more superficial, simply defining polite and acceptable behavior. Making your targets feel that you are leading them past either kind of limit is immensely seductive. 
People yearn to explore their dark side. Not everything in romantic love is supposed to be tender and soft; hint that you have a cruel, even sadistic streak. You do not respect age differences, marriage vows, family ties. Once the desire to transgress draws your targets to you, it will be hard for them to stop. Take them further than they imagined—the shared feeling of guilt and complicity will create a powerful bond.

#### Stir up the Transgressive and Taboo

##### Interpretation of Byron's Life
###### WHY
As children, we are able to vent the darker side of our characters, a side that all of us have. But under pressure from society, we slowly repress it. To get along, we learn to repress our dark sides, which become a kind of lost self, a part of our psyche buried beneath our polite appearance.

As adults, we secretly want to recapture that lost self—the more adventurous, less respectful, childhood part of us. We are drawn to those who live out their lost selves as adults, even if it involves some evil or destruction. 

###### HOW
Like Byron, become the lightning rod for such desires. 
- You must learn, to keep this potential under control, and to use it strategically. 
	- As the aura of the forbidden around you is drawing targets into your web,
	- do not overplay your dangerousness, or they will be frightened away. 
- Once you feel them falling under your spell, you have freer rein 
- IF they begin to imitate you, then take it further—mix in some cruelty, involve them in sin, crime, taboo activity, whatever it takes.
- Unleash the lost self within them; the more they act it out, the deeper your hold over them. 
- Going halfway will break the spell and create self-consciousness. Take it as far as you can.

> Baseness attracts everybody.

##### Keys to Seduction

Society and culture are based on limits — which behavior is acceptable and not. Yet, we dread for anarchy; the moment any kind of limit is imposed, we are instantly curious. 
- as we grow older, and become polite and deferential; more and more boundaries encumber our lives. 
	- Politness covers up frustration, unwanted compromise. 
- How can we explore the shadow side of our personality without incurring punishment or ostracism?

But give a person the sense that with you they will have a chance to explore the outer reaches of acceptable, polite behavior, that with you they can vent some of their closeted personality, and you create the ingredients for a deep and powerful seduction.
- You will have to go beyond the point of merely teasing them with an elusive fantasy. 
	- The shock and seductive power will come from the reality of what you are offering them.
- If they have followed you merely out of curiosity, they may feel some fear and hesitation, but once they are hooked, they will fond you hard to resist, for it is hard to return to a limit once you have transgressed and gone past it. 
	- The human cries out for more, and does not know when to stop. You will determine for them when it is time to stop.

The moment people feel that something is prohibited, a part of them will want it. That is what makes a married man or woman such a delicious target—the more someone is prohibited, the greater the desire.


The more illicit your seduction feels, the more powerful its effect.
- Give your targets the feeling that they are committing a kind of crime, a deed whose guilt they share with you. 
- Create public moments in which the two of you know something that those around you do not. 
	- It could be phrases and looks that only you recognize, a secret. 


People may be straining to remove restrictions on private behavior, to make everything freer, in the world today, but that only makes seduction more difficult and less exciting. Do what you can to reintroduce a feeling of transgression and crime, even if it is only psychological or illusory. There must be obstacles to overcome, social norms to flout, laws to break, before the seduction can be consummated. It might seem that a permissive society imposes few limits; find some. There will always be limits, sacred cows, behavioral standards—endless ammunition for stirring up the transgressive and taboo.


###### Duc de Richelieu strategy
#_ToDo_ a garder comme stratégie
He would often heighten the seduction by enveloping young adults in transgressive behavior, to which the young are particularly susceptible. For instance,
- he would find a way into the young girl's house and lure her into her bed; the parents would be just down the hall, adding the proper spice.
- Sometimes he would act as if they were about to be discovered, the momentary fright sharpening the overall thrill. 

In all cases, he would try to turn the young girl against her parents, ridiculing their religious zeal or prudery or pious behavior. The duke's strategy was to attack the values that his targets held dearest—precisely the values that represent a limit. 
- In a young person, family ties, religious ties, and the like are useful to the seducer; young people barely need a reason to rebel against them. 
- The strategy, though, can be applied to a person of any age: for every deeply held value there is a shadow side, a doubt, a desire to explore what those values forbid.




#### Symbol: The Forest.
The children are told not to go into the forest. There is no law there, only wilderness, wild animals, and criminals. But the chance to explore, the alluring darkness, and the fact that it is prohibited are impossible to resist. And once inside, they want to go farther and farther.

#### Reversal
The reversal of stirring up taboos would be to stay within the limits of acceptable behavior (*very tepid seduction*). 

Which is not to say that only evil or wild behavior is seductive; goodness, kindness, and an aura of spirituality can be tremendously attractive, since they are rare qualities.
- But notice that the game is the same. A person who is kind or good or spiritual within the limits that society prescribes has a weak appeal.
- It is those who go to the extreme—the Gandhis, the Krishnamurtis— who seduce us. 
	- They do not merely expound a spiritual lifestyle, they do away with all personal material comfort to live out their ascetic ideals. 
	- They too go beyond the limits, transgressing acceptable behavior, because societies would find it hard to function if everyone went to such lengths.
