---

People who have experienced a certain kind of pleasure in the past will try to repeat or relive it. The deepest-rooted and most pleasurable memories are usually those from earliest childhood, and are often unconsciously associated with a parental figure. 
- Bring your targets back to that point by placing yourself in the oedipal triangle and positioning them as the needy child
	- Unaware of the cause of their emotional response, they will fall in love with you. 
- Alternatively, you too can regress, letting them play the role of the protecting, nursing parent. 

In either case you are offering the ultimate fantasy:
- the chance to have an intimate relationship with mommy or daddy, son or daughter.

##### The Erotic Regression
As adults we tend to overvalue our childhood. We forget the pain and remember only the pleasure. Why? 
- Because the responsibilities of adult life are a burden so oppressive at times that we secretly yearn
	- for the dependency of childhood, 
	- for that person who looked after our every need, assumed our cares and worries.

**transference**: when Freud was talking to woman patient, he realize many fall in love with him, despite the age difference. He attribute it to 
- patient would delve into her childhood (*be talking*)
- She would talk about her relationship with her father, her earliest experiences of tenderness and love, and also of neglect and abandonment.
- The process would stir up powerful emotions and memories.
	- In a way, she would be transported back into her childhood. 
	- Intensifying this effect was the fact that Freud himself said little and made himself a little cold and distant, although he seemed to be caring—in other words, quite like the traditional father figure.
	- Meanwhile the patient was lying on a couch, in a helpless or passive position, so that the situation duplicated the roles of parent and child. 
- Eventually she would begin to direct some of the confused emotions she was dealing with toward Freud himself. Unaware of what was happening, she would relate to him as to her father. She would regress and fall in love.

###### HOW to create Transference

**transference** is a powerful way of creating an emotional attachment—the goal of any seduction. The method has infinite applications outside psychoanalysis. To practice it in real life, you need to play the therapist, encouraging people to talk about their childhood
- Most of us are only too happy to oblige; and our memories are so vivid and emotional that a part of us regresses just in talking about our early years. 
- Also, in the course of talking, little secrets slip out: 
	- we reveal all kinds of valuable information about our weaknesses and our mental makeup, information you must attend to and remember. 
- Do not take your targets' words at face value; 
	- they will often sugarcoat or overdramatize events in childhood. 
	- But pay attention to their tone of voice, to any nervous tics as they talk, and particularly to anything they do not want to talk about, anything they deny or that makes them emotional. 
- Many statements actually mean their opposite: 
	- should they say they hated their father, for instance, you can be sure that they are hiding a lot of disappointment— that they actually loved their father only too much, and perhaps never quite got what they wanted from him.
	- Listen closely for recurring themes and stories. Most important, learn to analyze emotional responses and see what lies behind them.

While they talk, maintain the therapist's pose—attentive but quiet, making occasional, nonjudgmental comments. 
- Be caring yet distant — somewhat blank, in fact—and they will begin to transfer emotions and project fantasies onto you.
- With the information you have gathered about their childhood, and the trusting bond you have forged, you can now begin to effect the regression.


Finish what is unfinished. Discover what your target never got and you have the ingredients for a deep-rooted seduction. 
- The key is not just to talk about memories—that is weak. 
- What you want is to get people to act out in their present old issues from their past, without their being aware of what is happening. 

The regressions you can effect fall into four main types.


##### The Infantile Regression.
The first bond between a mother and her infant is the most powerful one. Human babies have a long period of helplessness where they are dependent on their mother.
The key to effecting this regression is to reproduce the sense of unconditional love a mother has for her child. 
- Never judge your targets—let them do whatever they want, including behaving badly; 
	- at the same time surround them with loving attention, smother them with comfort.
- A part of them will regress to those earliest years when their mother took care of everything and rarely left them alone. 

This works on almost everyone, for unconditional love is the rarest and most treasured form. 
- You do not even have to tailor your behavior to anything specific in their childhood;
	- most of us have experienced this kind of attention. 
- Meanwhile, create atmospheres that reinforce the feeling you are generating
	- —warm environments, playful activities, bright, happy colors.


##### The Oedipal Regression.
After the bond between mother and child comes the oedipal triangle of mother, father, and child. It forms during the period of the child's earliest erotic fantasies.

Unconditional love has gone; now, inevitably, the parent must sometimes deny what the child desires. 
- Transport your victims back to this period. 
	- By playing a parental role, be loving, but also sometimes scold and instill some discipline. 
- Children actually love a little discipline—it makes them feel that the adult cares about them.
	- And adult children too will be thrilled if you mix your tenderness with a little toughness and punishment. 

Must be tailored to your target.
- First learned everything you can about their childhood—what they had too much of, what they lacked, and so on.
- IF the target was strongly attached to a parent, but that attachment was partially negative, the oedipal regression strategy can still be quite effective. 
- We always feel ambivalent toward a parent; even as we love them, we resent having had to depend on them. 
- Don't worry about stirring up these ambivalences, which don't keep us from being tied to our parents. 

Remember to include an erotic component in your parental behavior. Now your targets are something previously forbidden but now allowed.


##### The Ego Ideal Regression. 
As children, we often form an ideal figure out of our dreams and ambitions. 
- First, that ideal figure is the person we want to be.
- Then, in our adolescence, we turn our attention to others, often projecting our ideals onto them.
	- The first love with seem to have the ideal qualities we wanted for ourselves, or else may make us feel that we can play that ideal role in relation to them.

 We are secretly disappointed in
 -  how much we have had to compromise, 
 - how far below the ideal we have fallen as we have gotten older.
 - SO Make your targets feel they are living out this youthful ideal, and coming closer to being the person they wanted to be, and you will effect a different kind of regression, creating a feeling reminiscent of adolescence. 
 
 The relationship between you and the seduced is in this instance more equal than in the previous kinds of regressions—more like the affection between siblings. In fact the ideal is often modeled on a brother or sister. To create this effect, strive to reproduce the intense, innocent mood of a youthful infatuation.

##### The Reverse Parental Regression
Here you are the one to regress: you deliberately play the role of the cute, adorable, yet also sexually charged child. 

Older people always find younger people incredibly seductive.
- In the presence of youth, they feel a little of their own youth return;
	- but they are in fact older, and mixed into the invigoration they feel in young people's company is the pleasure of playing the mother or father to them
- IF a child has erotic feelings toward a parent, feelings that are quickly repressed, the parent must deal with the same problem in reverse. 
- Assume the role of the child in relation to your targets, however, and they get to act out some of those repressed erotic sentiments. 

The strategy may seem to call for a difference in age, but this is actually not critical. Marilyn Monroe's exaggerated little-girl qualities worked just fine on men her age. 

###### HOW 
Emphasizing a weakness or vulnerability on your part will give the target a chance to play the protector.


#### regression pattern
##### the classic oedipal regression pattern. 
HOW to
 1. treat your targets as children.
	 1. scolds, but the scolding is not threatening; it is tender, and has a teasing edge
	 2. mixes plenty of praise and approval in. 
 2.  Once the victims begins to regress, add physical excitement—some bodily contact to excite, subtle sexual overtones
 
 Often those who seem the most in command of themselves are the ripest for regression. In fact they are secretly longing for it, because their power, position, and responsibilities are more a burden than a pleasure.

#####  ego ideal regression
All of us carry within us an image of an ideal type of person whom we yearn to meet and love: composite made up of bits and pieces of different people from our youth, and even of characters in books and movies. 

It is nearly impossible to embody someone's ideal completely. But if you come close enough, if you evoke some of that ideal spirit, you can lead that person into a deep seduction. To effect this regression you must play the role of the therapist. 
- Get your targets to open up about their past, particularly their former loves and most particularly their first love.
- Pay attention to any expressions of disappointment, how this or that person did not give them what they wanted. 
- Take them to places that evoke their youth. 
	- In this regression you are creating not so much a relationship of dependency and immaturity but rather the adolescent spirit of a first love. 
-  There is a touch of innocence to the relationship. 
	- So much of adult life involves compromise, conniving, and a certain toughness.
	- Create the ideal atmosphere by keeping such things out, drawing the other person into a kind of mutual weakness, conjuring a second virginity. 
- There should be a dreamlike quality to the affair, as if the target were reliving that first love but could not quite believe it. Let all of this unfold slowly, each encounter revealing more ideal qualities. 
	- The sense of reliving a past pleasure is simply impossible to resist. 

##### another
 We are most definitely stamped forever by our parents, in ways we can never fully understand. But the parents are equally influenced and seduced by the child. 
 
 And just as the child struggles against sexual feelings toward the parent, the parent must repress comparable erotic feelings that lie just beneath the tenderness they feel. The best and most insidious way to seduce people is often to position yourself as the child. 
 - Imagining themselves stronger, more in control, they will be lured into your web. 
	 - They will feel they have nothing to fear. 
	 - Emphasize your immaturity, your weakness, and you let them indulge in fantasies of protecting and parenting you—a strong desire as people get older.
- What they do not realize is that you are getting under their skin, insinuating yourself—it is the child who is controlling the adult. 
	- Your innocence makes them want to protect you, but it is also sexually charged.
- In your presence, too, they will begin to regress as well, infected by your childish, playful spirit. don't push for favors. 
	- Parents prefer to spoil children who don't ask for things but invite them in their manner. 
- Seeming nonjudgmental and uncritical of those around you will make everything you do seem more natural and naive. 
- Have a happy, cheerful demeanor, but with a playful edge. 
- Emphasize any weaknesses you might have, things you cannot control.

##### Remember:
most of us remember our early years fondly, but often, paradoxically, the people with the strongest attachment to those times are the ones who had the most difficult childhoods. Actually, circumstances kept them from getting to be children, so they never really grew up, and they long for the paradise they never got to experience. These types are ripe targets for a reverse regression.

#### THEODOR REIK, OF LOVE AND LUST
I have stressed the fact that the beloved person is a substitute for the ideal ego. Two people who love each other are interchanging their ego-ideals. That they love each other means they love the ideal of themselves in the other one. There would be no love on earth if this phantom were not there. 

We fall in love because we cannot attain the image that is our better self and the best of our self. From this concept it is obvious that love itself is only possible on a certain cultural level or after a certain phase in the development of the personality has been reached. The creation of an ego-ideal itself marks human progress. When people are entirely satisfied with their actual selves, love is impossible. 

The transfer of the ego-ideal to a person is the most characteristic trait of love.


#### Symbol: The Bed. 
Lying alone in bed, the child feels unprotected, afraid, and needy. In a nearby room, there is the parent's bed. It is large and forbidding, site of things you are not supposed to know about. 

Give the seduced both feelings—helplessness and transgression—as you lay them into bed and put them to sleep.

#### Reversal
To reverse the strategies of regression, the parties to a seduction would have to remain adults during the process. This is not only rare, it is not very pleasurable. 

Seduction means realizing certain fantasies. 
- Being a mature and responsible adult is not a fantasy, it is a duty.
- Furthermore, a person who remains an adult in relation to you is harder to seduce. 
- In all kinds of seduction—political, media, personal—the target must regress. 

The only danger is that the child, wearying of dependence, turns against the parent and rebels. You must be prepared for this, and unlike a parent, never take it personally.
