[[Keep Them in Suspense - What Comes Next - Long version]]

---
The moment people feel they know what to expect from you,
- your spell on them is broken. 
- More: you have ceded them power. 

SO The only way to lead the seduced along and keep the upper hand is to create suspense, a calculated surprise.
- WHY: People love a mystery, and this is the key to luring them further into your web. 
- SO Behave in a way that leaves them wondering, "What are you up to?" 
	- Doing something they do not expect from you will give them a delightful sense of spontaneity—they will not be able to foresee what comes next. 
	- You are always one step ahead and in control. Give the victim a thrill with a sudden change of direction.

###### HOW suspense impact
I count upon taking [the French people] by surprise.
- A bold deed upsets people's equanimity,
- and they are dumbfounded by a great novelty.
—NAPOLEON BONAPARTE

The unexpected can be nothing more than a gesture, but a gesture that is totally uncommon. It's also about making people talk about it.


###### Casanova and Mathilde
 -> [[Mathilde seduction on Casanova]]

In seduction, you need to create constant tension and suspense, a feeling that with you nothing is predictable. 
- Do not think of this as a painful challenge. 
	- You are creating drama in real life, so pour your creative energies into it, have some fun. 
- There are all kinds of calculated surprises you can spring on your victims
	-  sending a letter from out of the blue, showing up unexpectedly,
	- taking them to a place they have never been. 
	- But best of all are surprises that reveal something new about your character. 

###### HOW to reveal something new about your character
This needs to be set up. 
- In those first few weeks, your targets will tend to make certain snap judgments about you, based on appearances. 
	- You know that this is not the real you, but it is how you act in social situations. Let them, however, have these impressions, and in fact accentuate them a little, without overacting. 
- NOW you have room to suddenly surprise them with some bold or poetic or naughty action.  -> [[Send Mixed Signals]]
	- Once they have changed their minds about you, surprise them again,
		- as Mathilde did with Casanova—first a nun who wants an affair, then a libertine, then a seductress with a sadistic streak.
	- As they strain to figure you out, they will be thinking about you all of the time, and will want to know more about you. 
		- Their curiosity will lead them further into your [web], until it is too late for them to turn back.

>This is always the law for the interesting. . . . If one just knows how to surprise, one always wins the game. The energy of the person involved is temporarily suspended; one makes it impossible for her to act.
>—SØREN KIERKEGAARD

##### Keys to Seduction
###### WHY the suspence
A child is usually a willful, stubborn creature who will deliberately do the opposite of what we ask. 
- But there is one scenario in which children will happily give up their usual willfulness: when they are promised a surprise.
- We get a similar thrill when we watch a movie or read a thriller. We stay in our seats, we turn the pages, happily enslaved by the suspense.


That suspense is the pleasure a woman has in being led by a confident dancer, letting go of any defensiveness she may feel and letting another person do the work. Falling in love involves anticipation; we are about to head off in a new direction, enter a new life, where everything will be strange. The seduced wants to be led, to be carried along like a child. If you are predictable, the charm wears off; everyday life is predictable. 


Not only does suddenness create a seductive jolt, it conceals manipulations. Appear somewhere unexpectedly, say or do something sudden, and people will not have time to figure out that your move was calculated. Take them to some new place as if it only just occurred to you, suddenly reveal some secret. Made emotionally vulnerable, they will be too bewildered to see through you. Anything that happens suddenly seems natural, and anything that seems natural has a seductive charm.

Finally, you might think it wiser to present yourself as someone reliable, not given to caprice.
- If so, you are in fact merely timid. It takes courage and effort to mount a seduction. Reliability is fine for drawing people in, but stay reliable and you stay a bore. Dogs are reliable, a seducer is not. 
- If, on the other hand, you prefer to improvise, imagining that any kind of planning or calculation is antithetical to the spirit of surprise, you are making a grave mistake. 
	- Constant improvisation simply means you are lazy, and thinking only about yourself. What often seduces a person is the feeling that you have expended effort on their behalf. You do not need to trumpet this too loudly, but make it clear in the gifts you make, the little journeys you plan, the little teases you lure people with. Little efforts like these will be more than amply rewarded by the conquest of the heart and willpower of the seduced.

#### Symbol: The Roller Coaster.
The car rises slowly to the top, then suddenly hurtles you into space, whips you to the side. The riders laugh and scream. 
- What thrills them is to let go, to grant control to someone else, who propels them in unexpected directions. 
- What new thrill awaits them around the next corner?

#### Reversal
Surprise can be unsurprising if you keep doing the same thing again and again. You need to vary the method of your surprises.
-> When you change direction, make the new direction truly new.

###### Madame de Pompadour - changing surprise
When Madame de Pompadour was the lover of the inveterately bored King Louis XV, she made each surprise different— a new amusement, a new game, a new fashion, a new mood. 
HENCE, he could never predict what would come next, and while he waited for the next surprise, his willpower was temporarily suspended.
