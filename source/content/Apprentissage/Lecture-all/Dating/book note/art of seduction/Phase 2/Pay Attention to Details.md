[[Pay Attention to Details - long version]]

---

Lofty words and grand gestures can be suspicious: why are you trying so hard to please? 

The details of a seduction—the subtle gestures, the offhand things you do—are often more charming and revealing. 
- You must learn to distract your victims with a myriad of pleasant little rituals—thoughtful gifts tailored just for them, clothes and adornments designed to please them, gestures that show the time and attention you are paying them. 
	- HENCE All of their senses are engaged in the details you orchestrate. 
-  WHY: Create spectacles to dazzle their eyes; mesmerized by what they see, they will not notice what you are really up to.
	- Learn to suggest the proper feelings and moods through details.

> Never tell someone what you are feeling; let them guess it in your looks and gestures. That is the more convincing language.


###### WHY: The Mesmerizing Effect (and HOW)
The key to distracting people is to fill their eyes and ears with details, little rituals, colorful objects.
-  Detail is what makes things seem real and substantial.
- A thoughtful gift won't seem to have an ulterior motive. 
- A ritual full of charming little actions is so enjoyable to watch. 
- Jewelry, handsome furnishings, touches of color in clothing, dazzle the eye. 
	- It is a childish weakness of ours: we prefer to focus on the pleasant little details rather than on the larger picture. 
- The more senses you appeal to, the more mesmerizing the effect. The objects you use in your seduction (gifts, clothes, etc.) speak their own language, and it is a powerful one.
- SO Never ignore a detail or leave one to chance. Orchestrate them into a spectacle and no one will notice how manipulative you are being.

###### Genji
you must attune your own senses to your targets, watching them carefully, adapting to their moods. 
- You sense when they are defensive and retreat. 
- You also sense when they are giving in, and move forward.
- In between, the details you set up—gifts, entertainments, the clothes you wear, the flowers you choose—are aimed precisely at their tastes and predilections.

Also, make her realize indirectly how charming and irresistible you are by surrounding her with unspoken details. Flash of light, parfum ... orchestrated every possible detail. And make the other pale in comparison!!

Attend to your targets' every move and desire, and reveal your attentiveness in the details and objects you surround them with, filling their senses with the mood you need to inspire. They can argue with your words, but not with the effect you have on their senses.

> Therefore in my view when the courtier wishes to declare his love he should do so by his actions rather than by speech, for a man's feelings are sometimes more clearly revealed by . . . a gesture of respect or a certain shyness than by volumes of words.

#### Keys to Seduction
When we were children, our senses were much more active. We noticed everything. As we grow older we no longer notice as much, for we are constantly hurrying to get things done, to move on to the next task. 

In seduction, you are always trying to bring the target back to the golden moments of childhood.
When your targets are with you, you must never give them the feeling they normally get in the real world, 
- where we are all rushed, ruthless, out for ourselves. 
- SO You need to deliberately slow things down, and return them to the simpler times of their youth.
	- The details that you orchestrate—colors, gifts, little ceremonies—are aimed at their senses, at the childish delight we take in the immediate charms of the natural world.
	- Their senses filled with delightful things, they grow less capable of reason and rationality. 
- Pay attention to detail and you will find yourself assuming a slower pace; 
	- your targets will not focus on what you might be after (sexual favors, power, etc.) because you seem so considerate, so attentive. 

###### Woman and seduction
Since time immemorial, women have known that within the most apparently self-possessed man is an animal whom they can lead by filling his senses with the proper physical lures. The key is to attack on as many fronts as possible. Do not ignore your voice, your gestures, your walk, your clothes, your glances. Some of the most alluring women in history have so distracted their victims with sensual detail that the men fail to notice it is all an illusion.

###### Rudolph Valentino
In the eyes of women all over the world, Rudolph Valentino reigned as the Great Lover through much of the 1920s. The qualities behind his appeal certainly included his handsome, almost pretty face, his dancing skills, the strangely exciting streak of cruelty in his manner. But his perhaps most endearing trait was his time-consuming approach to courtship. His films would show him seducing a woman slowly, with careful details—sending her flowers (choosing the variety to match the mood he wanted to induce), taking her hand, lighting her cigarette, escorting her to romantic places, leading her on the dance floor. These were silent movies, and his audiences never got to hear him speak—it was all in his gestures. Men came to hate him, for their wives and girlfriends now expected the slow, careful Valentino treatment.


###### HOW
You have to dress for your target—have to appeal to your target's tastes.

###### Word VS Gift
Gift
- Expensive gifts have no sentiment attached; they may temporarily excite but they are quickly forgotten
- The object that reflects its giver's attentiveness has a lingering sentimental power, which resurfaces every time its owner sees it.


Words
- come easily, and people distrust them.
	- Anyone can say the right words; and once they are said, nothing is binding, and they may even be forgotten altogether. 
- The gesture, the thoughtful gift, the little details seem much more real and substantial. 
	- They are also much more charming than lofty words about love, precisely because they speak for themselves and let the seduced read into them more than is there.
	- Never tell someone what you are feeling; let them guess it in your looks and gestures. That is the more convincing language.

#### Symbol: The Banquet. 
A feast has been prepared in your honor. Everything has been elaborately coordinated—the flowers, the decorations, the selection of guests, the dancers, the music, the five-course meal, the endlessly flowing wine. The Banquet loosens your tongue, and also your inhibitions.

#### Reversal
There is no reversal.
