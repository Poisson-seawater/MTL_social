[[Confuse Desire and Reality - The Perfect Illusion - long version]]

---

To compensate for the difficulties in their lives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming, imagining a future full of adventure, success, and romance. 
- IF you can create the illusion that through you they can live out their dreams, THEN you will have them at your mercy.
- HOW: It is important to start slowly, gaining their trust, and gradually constructing the fantasy that matches their desires. 
	- Aim at secret wishes that have been thwarted or repressed, stirring up uncontrollable emotions, clouding their powers of reason.
	- The perfect illusion is one that does not depart too much from reality, but has a touch of the unreal to it, like a waking dream, head the seduced to a point of confusion in which they can no longer tell the difference between illusion and reality (*like the salt analogy for writing*)

#### Fantasy in the Flesh

##### Understand Fantasy - the mind
The mind has two currents: 
- it wants to believe in things that are pleasant to believe in, 
- yet it has a self-protective need to be suspicious of people. 

IF you start off too theatrical, trying too hard to create a fantasy, you will feed that suspicious side of the mind, and once fed, the doubts will not go away. 

###### HOW to build a fantasy
You must start slowly, 
- building trust, 
	- while perhaps letting people see a little touch of something strange or exciting about you to tease their interest.
- Then you build up your story, 
	- like any piece of fiction. 
	- You have established a foundation of trust—now the fantasies and dreams you envelop them in are suddenly believable.

Remember: people want to believe in the extraordinary; with a little groundwork, a little mental foreplay, they will fall for your illusion. 
- If anything, err on the side of reality: use real props (*like the child Pei Pu showed Bouriscout*) and add the fantastical touches in your words, or an occasional gesture that gives you a slight unreality. 
- Once you sense that they are hooked, you can deepen the spell, go further and further into the fantasy.
	- At that point they will have gone so far into their own minds that you will no longer have to bother with verisimilitude.

##### HOW to Wish Fulfillment
=> The story of the Russian fake town in Crimea. 

When our emotions are engaged, we often have trouble seeing things as they are. 
- WHY: Feelings of love cloud our vision, making us color events to coincide with our desires. 
- SO: To make people believe in the illusions you create, you need to feed the emotions over which they have least control.
	- Often the best way to do this is to ascertain their unsatisfied desires, their wishes crying out for fulfillment. Perhaps
		- they want to see themselves as noble or romantic, but life has thwarted them. 
		- they want an adventure. 
- THEN, IF something seems to validate this wish, they become emotional and irrational, almost to the point of hallucination.

###### Example: Potemkin's illusion
Remember to envelop them in your illusion slowly. Potemkin did not start with grand spectacles, but with simple sights along the way, such as grazing cattle. Then he brought them on land, heightening the drama, until the calculated climax when the windows were flung open to reveal a mighty war machine—actually a few thousand men and boats lined up in such a way as to suggest many more. Like Potemkin, involve the target in some kind of journey, physical or otherwise. The feeling of a shared adventure is rife with fantasy associations. Make people feel that they are getting to see and live out something that relates to their deepest yearnings and they will see happy, prosperous villages where there are only facades.

> Here the real journey through Potemkin's fairyland began. It was like a dream—the waking dream of some magician who had discovered the secret of materializing his visions. . . . [Catherine] and her companions had left the world of reality behind. . . . Their talk was of Iphigenia and the ancient gods, and Catherine felt that she was both Alexander and Cleopatra.

#### Keys to Seduction
###### Understand
The real world can be unforgiving. Fortunately we develop the habit of dreaming early on and day dreaming. The problem is, these images and fantasies exist only in our minds, or on-screen. So we crave the real thing, not this endless daydreaming and titillation. 

Your task as a seducer is to someone's fantasy life by 
- embodying a fantasy figure,
- or creating a scenario resembling that person's dreams. 

Most people have a misconception about illusion.
- As any magician knows, it need not be built out of anything grand or theatrical; the grand and theatrical can in fact be destructive, calling too much attention to you and your schemes. 
- Instead create the appearance of normality. 
	- Once your targets feel secure—nothing is out of the ordinary—you have room to deceive them.

###### Exemple to get inspiration
like Emma Hart, dress and behave the way of your target taste. 
- If it's Greek mythology, become a Greek Goddess (like Cleopatra too). 


Every culture has a pool of such figures from the distant and not-so-distant past. You hint at a similarity, in spirit and in appearance—but you are flesh and blood. 
- What could be more thrilling than the sense of being in the presence of some fantasy figure going back to your earliest memories?

#### Symbol: Shangri-La.
Everyone has a vision in their mind of a perfect place 
- where people are kind and noble, 
- where their dreams can be realized and their wishes fulfilled, 
- where life is full of adventure and romance.

SO Lead the target on a journey there, give them a glimpse of Shangri-La through the mists on the mountain, and they will fall in love.

#### Reversal
No seduction can proceed without creating illusion, the sense of a world that is real but separate from reality.
