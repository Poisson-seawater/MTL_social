[[Isolate the victim - Long version]]

----

An isolated person is weak. By slowly isolating your victims, you make them more vulnerable to your influence.
- Their isolation may be psychological:
	- by filling their field of vision through the pleasurable attention you pay them, you crowd out everything else in their mind. They see and think only of you. 
- The isolation may also be physical: 
	- you take them away from their normal milieu, friends, family, home.
	- Give them the sense of being marginalized, in limbo—they are leaving one world behind and entering another.
- Once isolated like this, they have no outside support, and in their confusion they are easily led astray.
	- THEN Lure the seduced into your lair, where nothing is familiar.

##### Isolation—the Exotic Effect

You must lure your targets away, gently, slowly, from the affairs that fill their mind. And what will best lure them from their castles is the whiff of the exotic. 
- Offer something unfamiliar that will fascinate them and hold their attention. 
- Be different in your manners and appearance, and slowly envelop them in this different world of yours. 
- Keep your targets off balance with coquettish changes of mood
	-  Do not worry that the disruption you represent is making them emotional—that is a sign of their growing weakness. 
	- They may struggle or have doubts, but exotic pleasures are irresistible.
- Most people are ambivalent: 
	- on the one hand they feel comforted by their habits and duties,
	- on the other they are bored, and ripe for anything that seems exotic,
		- that seems to come from somewhere else. 

> The more you can get them into your world, the weaker they become.

##### Isolation—The "Only You" Effect

Do not give your targets the time or space to worry about, suspect, or resist you. Flood them with the kind of attention that crowds out all other thoughts, concerns, and problems. 

Remember—people secretly yearn to be led astray by someone who knows where they are going. It can be a pleasure to let go, and even to feel isolated and weak, if the seduction is done slowly and gracefully.

> Put them in a spot where they have no place to go, and they will die before fleeing.

##### Keys to Seduction
The people around you may seem strong, and more or less in control of their lives, but that is merely a facade. Underneath, people are more brittle than they let on. 
- What lets them seem strong is the series of nests and safety nets they envelop themselves in—their friends, their families, their daily routines, which give them a feeling of continuity, safety, and control.
- SO Suddenly pull the rug out from under them, drop them alone into some foreign place where the familiar signposts are gone or scrambled, and you will see a very different person. 

###### HOW to isolate
A target who is strong and settled is hard to seduce. But even the strongest people can be made vulnerable if you can isolate them from their nests and safety nets. 
- Block out their friends and family with your constant presence,
- alienate them from the world they are used to, and take them to places they do not know. 
- Get them to spend time in your environment. 
- Deliberately disturb their habits, get them to do things they have never done.
	- They will grow emotional, making it easier to lead them astray. 
- Disguise all this in the form of a pleasurable experience, and your targets will wake up one day distanced from everything that normally comforts them. 
- Then they will turn to you for help, like a child crying out for its mother when the lights are turned out. 
- ->  the isolated target is weak and vulnerable.

###### Understand
Your worst enemies in a seduction are often your targets' family and friends. 
- They are outside your circle and immune to your charms;
- they may provide a voice of reason to the seduced. 

SO You must work silently and subtly to alienate the target from them. 
- Insinuate that they are jealous of your target's good fortune in finding you, 
- or that they are parental figures who have lost a taste for adventure. 
	- for young people
- You represent excitement and life; the friends and parents represent habit and boredom.


The seducer enact a kind of killing—a psychological one.
- Our past attachments are a barrier to the present. Even people we have left behind can continue to have a hold on us. 
- SO As a seducer, you will be held up to the past, compared to previous suitors, perhaps found inferior.
	- Do not let it get to that point. Crowd out the past with your attentions in the present. 
	- If necessary, find ways to disparage their previous lovers—subtly or not so subtly, depending on the situation. 
		- Even go so far as to open old wounds, making them feel old pain and seeing by contrast how much better the present is. 

> Do not take the target just anywhere; pick the place that will have the most effective associations.

###### Religion and isolation
The seductive power of isolation goes beyond the sexual realm. In religion, devoted followers, they were encouraged to cut off their ties with the past—with their family and friends.
This kind of renunciation has been a requirement of many religious sects over the centuries. People who isolate themselves in this way are much more vulnerable to influence and persuasion.

###### Create danger
Finally, at some point in the seduction there must be a hint of danger in the mix. 
- Your targets should feel that they are gaining a great adventure in following you, 
	- but are also losing something—a part of their past, their cherished comfort. 
- Actively encourage these ambivalent feelings. 
	- An element of fear is the proper spice; 
		- although too much fear is debilitating, in small doses it makes us feel alive. 
	- Like diving out of an airplane, it is exciting, a thrill, at the same time that it is a little frightening. And the only person there to break the fall, or catch them, is you.

#### Symbol: The Pied Piper. 
A jolly fellow in his red and yellow cloak, he lures the children from their homes with the delightful sounds of his flute.
- Enchanted, they do not notice how
	- far they are walking,
	- they are leaving their families behind. T
- They do not even notice the cave he eventually leads them into, and which closes upon them forever.

#### Reversal
The risks of this strategy: isolate someone too quickly and you will induce a sense of panic ending up in the target's taking flight.

The isolation you bring must be gradual, and disguised as pleasure—the pleasure of knowing you, leaving the world behind.

In any case, some people are too fragile to be cut off from their base of support. 
- The great modern courtesan Pamela Harriman had a solution to this problem:
	- she isolated her victims from their families, their former or present wives, AND in place of those old connections she quickly set up new comforts for her lovers. 
	- She overwhelmed them with attention, attending to their every need.
- It is unwise to keep the seduced dangling in midair for too long, with nothing familiar or comforting in sight. 
	- Instead, replace the familiar things you have cut them off from with a new home, a new series of comforts.
