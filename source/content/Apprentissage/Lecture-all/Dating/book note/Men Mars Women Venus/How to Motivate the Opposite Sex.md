Men are motivated and
empowered when they feel
needed…. Women are
motivated and empowered
when they feel cherished (feels cared for and respected)


###### Men's love
when a man is in love he is motivated to be the best he can be
in order to serve others. When his heart is open, he feels so confident in
himself that he is capable of making major changes. Given the opportunity
to prove his potential, he expresses his best self. Only when he feels he
cannot succeed does he regress back to his old selfish ways.

Not to be needed is a slow
death for a man.

###### women's love
Most men have little awareness of how important it is to a woman to feel
supported by someone who cares. Women are happy when they believe
their needs will be met. When a woman is upset, overwhelmed, confused,
exhausted, or hopeless what she needs most is simple companionship. She
needs to feel she is not alone. She needs to feel loved and cherished.



In her younger years, a woman is much more willing to sacrifice
and mold herself to fulfill her partner’s needs. In a man’s younger years, he
is much more self-absorbed and unaware of the needs of others. As a
woman matures she realizes how she may have been giving up herself in
order to please her partner. As a man matures he realizes how he can better
serve and respect others. As a woman matures she also learns new strategies for giving, but
her major change tends to be learning to set limits in order to receive what
she wants.

Setting limits and receiving are very scary for a woman. She is commonly
afraid of needing too much and then being rejected, judged, or abandoned.
Rejection, judgment, and abandonment are most painful because deep
inside her unconscious she holds the incorrect belief that she is unworthy of
receiving more. This belief was formed and reinforced in childhood every
time she had to suppress her feelings, needs, or wishes.

Ironically, men are primarily
motivated by being needed, but are turned off by neediness.
At such times, a woman mistakenly assumes that having needs has turned
him off when in truth it is her hopelessness, desperation, and mistrust that
has done so

Without recognizing that men need to be trusted, it is difficult
and confusing for women to understand the difference between needing and
neediness.
“Needing” is openly reaching out and asking for support from a man in a
trusting manner, one that assumes that he will do his best. This empowers
him. “Neediness,” however, is desperately needing support because you
don’t trust you will get it. It pushes men away and makes them feel rejected
and unappreciated.

###### How the Venusians Learned to Feel Worthy
For centuries the Venusians compensated for this fundamental fear of
unworthiness by being attentive and responsive to the needs of others. They
would give and give, but deep inside they did not feel worthy of receiving.




##### LEARNING TO GIVE
A man’s deepest fear is that he is not good enough or that he is incompetent.
He compensates for this fear by focusing on increasing his power and
competence. Success, achievement, and efficiency are foremost in his life.

Just as women are sensitive to feeling rejected when they don’t get the
attention they need, men are sensitive to feeling that they have failed when
a woman talks about problems. This is why it is so hard for him to listen
sometimes. He wants to be her hero. When she is disappointed or unhappy
over anything, he feels like a failure. Her unhappiness confirms his deepest
fear: he is just not good enough. Many women today don’t realize how
vulnerable men are and how much they need love too. Love helps him to
know that he is enough to fulfill others.
