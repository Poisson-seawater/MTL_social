One of the most difficult challenges in our loving relationships is
handling differences and disagreements. Often when couples disagree their
discussions can turn into arguments and then without much warning into
battles. Suddenly they stop talking in a loving manner and automatically
begin hurting each other: blaming, complaining, accusing, demanding,
resenting, and doubting.

As a basic guideline: never argue. Instead discuss the pros and cons of
something. Negotiate for what you want but don’t argue. It is possible to be
honest, open, and even express negative feelings without arguing or
fighting.



###### anatomy of an argument
1. A woman expresses her upset feelings about “XYZ.”
2. A man explains why she shouldn’t be upset about “XYZ.”
3. She feels invalidated and becomes more upset. (She is now more
upset about being invalidated than about “XYZ.”)
4. He feels her disapproval and becomes upset. He blames her for
upsetting him and expects an apology before making up.
5. She apologizes and wonders what happened, or she becomes more
upset and the argument escalates into a battle.


Most arguments escalate when
a man begins to invalidate a
woman’s feelings and she
responds to him
disapprovingly.
###### on "I'm sorry"
Men rarely say “I’m sorry” because on Mars it means you have done
something wrong and you are apologizing. Women, however, say “I’m
sorry” as a way to say “I care about what you are feeling.” It doesn’t mean
they are apologizing for doing something wrong.

###### How Women Unknowingly Start Arguments
The most common way women unknowingly start arguments is by not
being direct when they share their feelings. Instead of directly expressing
her dislike or disappointment, a woman asks rhetorical questions and
unknowingly (or knowingly) communicates a message of disapproval.
