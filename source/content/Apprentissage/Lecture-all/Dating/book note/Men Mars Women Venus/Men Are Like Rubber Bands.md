When they pull away, they can stretch only
so far before they come springing back. rubber band is the perfect metaphor
to understand the male intimacy cycle. This cycle involves getting close,
pulling away, and then getting close again.

When a man loves a woman,
periodically he needs to pull
away before he can get closer.

When a man springs back, he picks
up the relationship at whatever degree of intimacy it was when he stretched
away. He doesn’t feel any need for a period of getting reacquainted again.

When a man springs back,
before a woman can open up again to him she generally wants and needs
time and conversation to reconnect. This transition can be more graceful if a
man understands a woman may need more time to regain the same level of
intimacy—especially if she felt hurt when he pulled away.

###### Why Men Pull Away

Men begin to feel their need for autonomy and independence after they have fulfilled their need for intimacy. A man automatically alternates between needing intimacy
and autonomy.


To a certain extent a man loses
himself through connecting
with his partner.
