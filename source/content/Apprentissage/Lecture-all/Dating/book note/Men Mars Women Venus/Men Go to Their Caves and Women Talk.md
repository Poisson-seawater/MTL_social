One of the biggest differences between men and women is how they cope
with stress. Men become increasingly focused and withdrawn while women
become increasingly overwhelmed and emotionally involved. At these
times, a man’s needs for feeling good are different from a woman’s. He
feels better by solving problems while she feels better by talking about
problems.



###### Men coping with stress
When a Martian gets upset he never talks about what is bothering him. He
would never burden another Martian with his problem unless his friend’s
assistance was necessary to solve the problem. Instead he becomes very
quiet and goes to his private cave to think about his problem, mulling it
over to find a solution. When he has found a solution, he feels much better
and comes out of his cave.
If he can’t find a solution then he does something to forget his problems,
like reading the news or playing a game. By disengaging his mind from the
problems of his day, gradually he can relax. If his stress is really great it
takes getting involved with something even more challenging,

When a man is stressed he will withdraw into the cave of his mind and
focus on solving a problem. He generally picks the most urgent problem or
the most difficult. He becomes so focused on solving this one problem that
he temporarily loses awareness of everything else. Other problems and
responsibilities fade into the background.

However, if he cannot find a solution to his problem, then he remains
stuck in the cave. To get unstuck he is drawn to solving little problems, like
reading the news, watching TV, driving his car, doing physical exercise,
watching a football game, playing basketball, and so forth. Any challenging
activity that initially requires only 5 percent of his mind can assist him in
forgetting his problems and becoming unstuck. Then the next day he can
redirect his focus to his problem with greater success.

On Venus sharing your problems with another actually is considered a
sign of love and trust and not a burden. Venusians are not ashamed of
having problems. Their egos are dependent not on looking “competent” but
rather on being in loving relationships. They openly share feelings of being
overwhelmed, confused, hopeless, and exhausted.
A Venusian feels good about herself when she has loving friends with
whom to share her feelings and problems

A woman under stress is not
immediately concerned with
finding solutions to her
problems but rather seeks relief
by expressing herself and being
understood

To feel better, women talk about past problems, future problems,
potential problems, even problems that have no solutions. The more talk
and exploration, the better they feel. This is the way women operate. To
expect otherwise is to deny a woman her sense of self.

Just as a man who is stuck in the cave needs little problems to distract
him, a woman who doesn’t feel heard will need to talk about other problems
that are less immediate to feel relief. To forget her own painful feelings she
may become emotionally involved in the problems of others. In addition
she may find relief through discussing the problems of her friends, relatives,
and associates.

Women commonly enjoy letting
the suspense build because it brings more feeling into the story. Another
woman appreciates this buildup, but a man can be easily frustrated.

Once she empty her bag, a woman get back to being positive and optimiste. Just like men crying mean he won't be usefull for 11h while a woman crying mean she will become usefull in 5min. 

##### Coexistance
After the Martians learned how to listen they made a most amazing
discovery. They began to realize that listening to a Venusian talk about
problems could actually help them come out of their caves in the same way
as watching the news on TV or reading a newspaper.
