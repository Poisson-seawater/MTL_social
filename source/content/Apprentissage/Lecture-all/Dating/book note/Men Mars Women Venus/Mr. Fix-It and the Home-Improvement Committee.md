The most frequently expressed complaint women have about men is that
men don’t listen

Martians value power, competency, efficiency, and achievement. They are
always doing things to prove themselves and develop their power and skills.
Their sense of self is defined through their ability to achieve results. They
experience fulfillment primarily through success and accomplishment.
A man’s sense of self is defined
through his ability to achieve
results.

Everything on Mars is a reflection of these values. Even their dress is
designed to reflect their skills and competence. Police officers, soldiers,
businessmen, scientists, cab drivers, technicians, and chefs all wear
uniforms or at least hats to reflect their competence and power.
They don’t read magazines like Psychology Today, Self, or People. They
are more concerned with outdoor activities, like hunting, fishing, and racing
cars. They are interested in the news, weather, and sports and couldn’t care
less about romance novels and self-help books.
They are more interested in “objects” and “things” rather than people and
feelings

Men are preoccupied with the “things” that can
help them express power by creating results and achieving their goals.
Achieving goals is very important to a Martian because it is a way for
him to prove his competence and thus feel good about himself. And for him
to feel good about himself he must achieve these goals by himself.
Someone else can’t achieve them for him. Martians pride themselves in
doing things all by themselves. Autonomy is a symbol of efficiency, power,
and competence.

To offer a man unsolicited
advice is to presume that he
doesn’t know what to do or
that he can’t do it on his own.

Because he is handling his problems on his own, a Martian rarely talks
about his problems unless he needs expert advice. He reasons: “Why
involve someone else when I can do it by myself?” He keeps his problems
to himself unless he requires help from another to find a solution. Asking
for help when you can do it yourself is perceived as a sign of weakness.
However, if he truly does need help, then it is a sign of wisdom to get it.
In this case, he will find someone he respects and then talk about his
problem. Talking about a problem on Mars is an invitation for advice.
Another Martian feels honored by the opportunity. Automatically he puts on
his Mr. Fix-It hat, listens for a while, and then offers some jewels of advice.


##### Woman
A woman’s sense of self is
defined through her feelings
and the quality of her
relationships

They experience fulfillment through sharing and relating.

enjoy wearing a different outfit every
day, according to how they are feeling. Personal expression, especially of
their feelings, is very important. They may even change outfits several
times a day as their mood changes.
Communication is of primary importance. To share their personal
feelings is much more important than achieving goals and success. Talking
and relating to one another is a source of tremendous fulfillment.

women are relationship oriented; they are
more concerned with expressing their goodness, love, and caring. Two
Martians go to lunch to discuss a project or business goal; they have a
problem to solve. In addition, Martians view going to a restaurant as an
efficient way to approach food: no shopping, no cooking, and no washing
dishes. For Venusians, going to lunch is an opportunity to nurture a
relationship, for both giving support to and receiving support from a friend.
Women’s restaurant talk can be very open and intimate, almost like the
dialogue that occurs between therapist and patient.

Venusians are very intuitive. They have developed this ability through
centuries of anticipating the needs of others. They pride themselves in being
considerate of the needs and feelings of others. A sign of great love is to
offer help and assistance to another Venusian without being asked.
