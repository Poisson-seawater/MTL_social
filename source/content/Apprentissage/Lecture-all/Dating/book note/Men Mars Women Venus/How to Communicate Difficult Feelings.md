Write a letter then share it. It is helpful to read your partner’s letter out loud because it helps them feel heard.
You can receive one, then be in a state of not being ready to answer the love ask. So the best is to go and write your own love letter.

###### STEP 2: WRITING A RESPONSE LETTER
Writing a Response Letter is the second step in the Love Letter Technique.
Once you have expressed both your negative and positive feelings, taking
an additional three to five minutes to write a Response Letter can be a
healing process. In this letter, you will write the kind of response you would
like to have from your partner.


The following lead-in phrases can get you started:
Thank you for …
I understand …
I am sorry …
You deserve …
I want …
I love …

Writing out what we actually want and need increases our
openness to receiving the support we deserve.
