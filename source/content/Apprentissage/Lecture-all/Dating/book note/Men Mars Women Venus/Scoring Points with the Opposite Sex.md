When a woman keeps score, no
matter how big or small a gift
of love is, it scores one point;
each gift has equal value.


###### 101 WAYS TO SCORE POINTS WITH A WOMAN
1. Upon returning home find her first before doing anything else and
give her a hug.
2. Ask her specific questions about her day that indicate an
awareness of what she was planning to do (e.g., “How did your
appointment with the doctor go?”).
3. Practice listening and asking questions.
4. Resist the temptation to solve her problems—empathize instead.
5. Give her twenty minutes of unsolicited, quality attention (don’t
read the newspaper or be distracted by anything else during this
time).
6. Bring her cut flowers as a surprise as well as on special occasions.
7. Plan a date several days in advance, rather than waiting for Friday
night and asking her what she wants to do.

8. If she generally makes dinner or if it is her turn and she seems
tired or really busy, offer to make dinner.
9. Compliment her on how she looks.
10. Validate her feelings when she is upset.

14. When she asks for support, say yes or no without making her
wrong for asking.
15. Whenever her feelings have been hurt, give her some empathy
and tell her “I’m sorry you feel hurt.” Then be silent; let her feel
your understanding of her hurt. Don’t offer solutions or
explanations why her hurt is not your fault.
16. Whenever you need to pull away, let her know you will be back
or that you need some time to think about things.
17. When you’ve cooled off and you come back, talk about what was
bothering you in a respectful, nonblaming way, so she doesn’t
imagine the worst.

19. When she talks to you, put down the magazine or turn off the TV
and give her your full attention.
20. If she usually washes the dishes, occasionally offer to wash the
dishes, especially if she is tired that day.
21. Notice when she is upset or tired and ask what she has to do.

at the store, and remember to pick it up.

exciting or to tell her “I love you.”

doesn’t have to.

###### How points work for men
Certainly a man also requires
equal participation from a
woman in doing the domestic
duties of day-to-day life, but if
he is not appreciated, then her
contribution is nearly
meaningless and completely
unimportant to him.

Men just give point every time they receive love.
