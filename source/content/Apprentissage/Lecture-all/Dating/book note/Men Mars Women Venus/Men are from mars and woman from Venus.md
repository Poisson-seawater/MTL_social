We mistakenly assume that if
our partners love us they will
react and behave in certain
ways—the ways we react and
behave when we love someone.


##### Resum

In chapter 2 we will explore how men’s and women’s values are
inherently different and try to understand the two biggest mistakes we make
in relating to the opposite sex: men mistakenly offer solutions and
invalidate feelings while women offer unsolicited advice and direction.
Through understanding our Martian/Venusian background it becomes
obvious why men and women unknowingly make these mistakes. By
remembering these differences we can correct our mistakes and
immediately respond to each other in more productive ways.
In chapter 3 we’ll discover the different ways men and women cope with
stress. While Martians tend to pull away and silently think about what’s
bothering them, Venusians feel an instinctive need to talk about what’s
bothering them. You will learn new strategies for getting what you want at
these conflicting times.
We will explore how to motivate the opposite sex in chapter 4. Men are
motivated when they feel needed while women are motivated when they
feel cherished. We will discuss the three steps for improving relationships
and explore how to overcome our greatest challenges: men need to
overcome their resistance to giving love while women must overcome their
resistance to receiving it.
In chapter 5 you’ll learn how men and women commonly misunderstand
each other because they speak different languages. A Martian/Venusian
Phrase Dictionary is provided to translate commonly misunderstood
expressions. You will learn how men and women speak and even stop
speaking for entirely different reasons. Women will learn what to do when a
man stops talking, and men will learn how to listen better without becoming
frustrated.
In chapter 6 you will discover how men and women have different needs
for intimacy. A man gets close but then inevitably needs to pull away.
Women will learn how to support this pulling-away process so he will
spring back to her like a rubber band. Women also will learn the best times
for having intimate conversations with a man.
We will explore in chapter 7 how a woman’s loving attitudes rise and fall
rhythmically in a wave motion. Men will learn how correctly to interpret
these sometimes sudden shifts of feeling. Men also will learn to recognize
when they are needed the most and how to be skillfully supportive at those
times without having to make sacrifices.
In chapter 8 you’ll discover how men and women give the kind of love
they need and not what the opposite sex needs. Men primarily need a kind
of love that is trusting, accepting, and appreciative. Women primarily need
a kind of love that is caring, understanding, and respectful. You will
discover the six most common ways you may unknowingly be turning off
your partner.
In chapter 9 we will explore how to avoid painful arguments. Men will
learn that by acting as if they are always right they may invalidate a
woman’s feelings. Women will learn how they unknowingly send messages
of disapproval instead of disagreement, thus igniting a man’s defenses. The
anatomy of an argument will be explored along with many practical
suggestions for establishing supportive communication.
Chapter 10 will show how men and women keep score differently. Men
will learn that for Venusians every gift of love scores equally with every
other gift, regardless of size. Instead of focusing on one big gift men are
reminded that the little expressions of love are just as important; 101 ways
to score points with women are listed. Women, however, will learn to
redirect their energies into ways that score big with men by giving men
what they want.
In chapter 11 you’ll learn ways to communicate with each other during
difficult times. The different ways men and women hide feelings are
discussed along with the importance of sharing feelings. The Love Letter
Technique is recommended for expressing negative feelings to your partner,
as a way of finding greater love and forgiveness.
You will understand why Venusians have a more difficult time asking for
support in chapter 12, as well as why Martians commonly resist requests.
You will learn how the phrases “could you” and “can you” turn off men and
what to say instead. You will learn the secrets for encouraging a man to give
more and discover in various ways the power of being brief, direct, and
using the correct wording.
In chapter 13 you’ll discover the four seasons of love. This realistic
perspective of how love changes and grows will assist you in overcoming
the inevitable obstacles that emerge in any relationship. You will learn how
your past or your partner’s past can affect your relationship in the present
and discover other important insights for keeping the magic of love alive.
In each chapter of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus you will
discover new secrets for creating loving and lasting relationships. Each new
discovery will increase your ability to have fulfilling relationships.
