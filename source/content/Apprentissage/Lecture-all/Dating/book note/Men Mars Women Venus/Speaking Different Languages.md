The Martian and Venusian
languages had the same words,
but the way they were used
gave different meanings; they had different connotations or emotional emphasis

##### EXPRESSING FEELINGS VERSUS EXPRESSING INFORMATION

To fully express their feelings,
women assume poetic license to
use various superlatives,
metaphors, and
generalizations.


For example, when a
woman says “I feel like you never listen,” she does not expect the word
never to be taken literally. Using the word never is just a way of expressing
the frustration she is feeling at the moment. It is not to be taken as if it were
factual information.

Women dramatic language implied a particular request.

###### women vocabulary
**“We never go out”** translated into Martian means “I feel like going
out and doing something together. We always have such a fun time,
and I love being with you. What do you think? Would you take me out
to dinner? It has been a few days since we went out.”

**“Everyone ignores me”** translated into Martian means “Today, I am
feeling ignored and unacknowledged. I feel as though nobody sees me. I start to feel like I am not important to you. I am afraid your work is
more important than me. Would you give me a hug and tell me how
special I am to you?”

**“I am so tired, I can’t do anything”** translated into Martian means “I
have been doing so much today. I really need a rest before I can do
anything more. I am so lucky to have your support. Would you give me
a hug and reassure me that I am doing a good job and that I deserve a
rest?”

**"I want to forget everything”** translated into Martian means “I want
you to know that I love my work and my life but today I am so
overwhelmed. I would love to do something really nurturing for
myself before I have to be responsible again. I want to forget everything” translated into Martian means “I want
you to know that I love my work and my life but today I am so
overwhelmed. I would love to do something really nurturing for
myself before I have to be responsible again.

**“This house is always a mess”** translated into Martian means “Today
I feel like relaxing, but the house is so messy. I am frustrated and I

it?”


**“No one listens to me anymore”** translated into Martian means “I am
afraid I am boring to you. I am afraid you are no longer interested in
me. I seem to be very sensitive today. Would you give me some special
attention? I would love it. I’ve had a hard day and feel as though no
one wants to hear what I have to say. “Would you listen to me and continue to ask me supportive
questions such as: ‘What happened today? What else happened? How
did you feel? What did you want? How else do you feel?’ Also support
me by saying caring, acknowledging, and reassuring statements such
as: ‘Tell me more’ or ‘That’s right’ or ‘I know what you mean’ or ‘I
understand.’ Or just listen, and occasionally when I pause make one of
these reassuring sounds: ‘oh,’ ‘humph,’ ‘uh-huh,’ and ‘hmmm.’ ”
(Note: Martians had never heard of these sounds before arriving on
Venus.)


**“Nothing is working”** translated into Martian means “Today I am so
overwhelmed and I am so grateful that I can share my feelings with
you. It helps me so much to feel better. Today it seems like nothing I
do works. I know that this is not true, but I sure feel that way when I
get so overwhelmed by all the things I still have to do. Would you give
me a hug and tell me that I am doing a great job. It would sure feel
good

**“You don’t love me anymore”** translated into Martian means “Today
I am feeling as though you don’t love me. I am afraid I have pushed
you away. I know you really do love me, you do so much for me.
Today I am just feeling a little insecure. Would you reassure me of
your love and tell me those three magic words, I love you. When you do that it feels so good.”

“**We are always in a hurry”** translated into Martian means “I feel so
rushed today. I don’t like rushing. I wish our life was not so hurried. I
know it is nobody’s fault and I certainly don’t blame you. I know you
are doing your best to get us there on time and I really appreciate how
much you care. “Would you empathize with me and say something like, ‘It is hard
always rushing around. I don’t always like rushing either.’ ”


**“I want more romance”** translated into Martian means “Sweetheart,
you have been working so hard lately. Let’s take some time out for
ourselves. I love it when we can relax and be alone without the kids
around and no work pressures. You are so romantic. Would you surprise me with flowers sometime soon and take me out on a date? I
love being romanced.”


###### Why Women Talk
1. To convey or gather information. (This is generally the only reason a
man talks.)
2. To explore and discover what it is she wants to say.(He stops talking
to figure out inside what he wants to say. She talks to think out loud.)
3. To feel better and more centered when she is upset.(He stops talking
when he is upset. In his cave he has a chance to cool off.)
4. To create intimacy. Through sharing her inner feelings she is able to
know her loving self. (A Martian stops talking to find himself again.
Too much intimacy, he fears, will rob him of himself.)


#### other stuff
When a man pulls away, a woman appreciates him saying out loud “I
need some time to think about this, I will be back” or “I need some time to
be alone. I will be back.” It is amazing how the simple words “I will be
back” make such a profound difference.
