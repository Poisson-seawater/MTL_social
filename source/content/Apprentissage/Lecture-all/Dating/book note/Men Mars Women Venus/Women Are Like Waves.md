Awoman is like a wave. When she feels loved her self-esteem rises and
falls in a wave motion. When she is feeling really good, she will reach a
peak, but then suddenly her mood may change and her wave crashes down.
This crash is temporary. After she reaches bottom suddenly her mood will
shift and she will again feel good about herself. Automatically her wave
begins to rise back up.

When a woman’s wave rises she feels she has an abundance of love to
give, but when it falls she feels her inner emptiness and needs to be filled
up with love. This time of bottoming out is a time for emotional
housecleaning.


A woman’s ability to give and receive love in her relationships is
generally a reflection of how she is feeling about herself. When she is not
feeling as good about herself, she is unable to be as accepting and
appreciative of her partner. At her down times, she tends to be overwhelmed
or more emotionally reactive. When her wave hits bottom she is more
vulnerable and needs more love. It is crucial that her partner understand
what she needs at these times, otherwise he may make unreasonable
demands. And that she HAVE to hit the bottom, then she can rise. Hence, she may talk and get "worst", that is just normal. 



When a woman goes into her well her deepest issues tend to surface.
These issues may have to do with the relationship, but usually they are
heavily charged from her past relationships and childhood. Whatever
remains to be healed or resolved from her past inevitably will come up.
Here are some of the common feelings she may experience as she goes into
the well.
Warning Signs for Men That She May Be Going into Her Well or When
She Needs His Love the Most
Shee feels: Overwhelmed
She may say: “There is so much to do.”
Shee feels: Insecure
She may say: “I need more.”
Shee feels: Resentful
She may say: “I do everything.”
Shee feels: Worried
She may say: “But what about …”
Shee feels: Confused
She may say: “I don’t understand why …”
Shee feels: Exhausted
She may say: “I can’t do anything more.”
Shee feels: Hopeless
She may say: “I don’t know what to do.”
Shee feels: Passive
She may say: “I don’t care, do what you want.”
Shee feels: Demanding
She may say: “You should …”
Shee feels: Withholding
She may say: “No, I don’t want to …”
Shee feels: Mistrustful
She may say: “What do you mean by that?”
Shee feels: Controlling
She may say: “Well, did you …?”
Shee feels: Disapproving
She may say: “How could you forget …?”
As she feels more and more supported at these difficult times, she begins
to trust the relationship and is able to journey in and out of her well without
conflict in her relationship or struggle in her life. This is the blessing of a
loving relationship.



Men argue for the right to be
free while women argue for the
right to be upset. Men want
space while women want
understanding.


###### Three Steps for Supporting Her When He Needs to Pull Away
1. Accept Your Limitations
	1. Don’t try to listen when you can’t.
2. Understand Her Pain
	1. Next, you need to understand that she needs more than you can give at this moment. Her pain is valid. Don’t make her wrong for needing more or for being hurt. It hurts to be abandoned when she needs your love. You are not wrong for needing space, and she is not wrong for wanting to be close. You may be afraid that she will not forgive you or trust. She can be more trusting and forgiving if you are caring and understanding of her hurt
3. Avoid Arguing and Give Reassurance
	1. By understanding her hurt you won’t make her wrong for being upset and in pain. Although you can’t give the support she wants and needs, you can avoid making it worse by arguing. Reassure her that you will be back, andthen you will be able to give her the support she deserves.


When a man can’t listen to a woman’s hurt feelings because he needs to
pull away, he can say “I understand you feel hurt and I need some time to
think about it. Let’s take a time-out.”


##### Money Doesn’t Fulfill Emotional Needs
As a woman’s financial needs
are fulfilled she becomes more
aware of her emotional needs.
