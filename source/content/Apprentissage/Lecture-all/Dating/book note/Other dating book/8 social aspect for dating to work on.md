from [[Fondamental of femal dynamic.canvas|Fondamental of femal dynamic]], to focus on one at a time
1. hold strong eye contact
2. do not barter for attention
3. do no chose her OR force rapport
4. do not qualify yourself / try to impress / seek her reaction & approval
5. be outcome independant and Non-reactive
6. provide value
7. act honestly, show congruance & consistancy
8. interact as Man to Woman


TIPS to work:
- takea 4h/week for social training
- build social momentum

###### 1 
Eye contact: show confidence
Smile = friendly
+> don't look tence

###### 2 
that is:
- don't creat indebtness (by gift and compliment) -> show overcompassation
- speak freely your mind

###### 3
Chase is seeking for her validation.
How to behave:
- be ready to walk away
- woman chase you
- creat opportunity by leading her. Woman forgive bad decision better than indecision.

###### 4
When trying to impress her, you are saying your succes come from external factor
WHILE if a woman is telling her accomplishment -> she is trying to prove her value = good sign
- she want her reward to be with you !

###### 5
That mean
- it's about the journey and discipline of becoming social VS the result (*fail often fail fast*)
- invest without attachment

Reactive <=> Butt-hunt: it's showing as a needy caracter.
VS 
Non-reactive: 
- hold your state & ground, composure & confidence
- what mean rejection from a stranger ?
	- <=> heaven in heart while walking throught hell
- WHY: it show you will respect her decision regarding of the outcome. 

Show Independant ex: if try to kiss her, she show her cheek -> keep talking as nothing happen. 


###### 6
To provide value:
- do not enter interview mode
- give without expecting reward -> just spread good vibe and my aura
	- IF do so, THEN people will want you in their life

Woman won't naturally entertain you (a stranger), so talk:
- make statement instead of question
- make assumption about her instead of question
	- you are right -> she is impress
	- you are wrong -> she will correct you (hence qualifying herself)

###### 7
-> [[Loi 32 - Toucher l’imaginaire]]
BUT on préfère quelqu'un d'anticipable plutôt qu'un menteur.

ON congruancy: abording by asking the time -> show you are lying about your intention !!


###### 8
That mean
- Take the risk of rejection.
- Abording intention is: I want to know you.
- DON'T be apologetic ==BE EMPATHETIC==
- show (*by compliment*) why you like her not just for her physical beauty
- Be realiable => show vulnerability
- woman have a social pressure to always be perfect SO create a safe place for her to be her <=> be imperfect without judgment.
