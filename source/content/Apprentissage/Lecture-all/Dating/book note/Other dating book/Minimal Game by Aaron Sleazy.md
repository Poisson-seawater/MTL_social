> Maximise your appeal to women (your [[sexual market value]])

If she doesn’t like you within the first five minutes, chances are low that she will like you after 5 hours.  
So cut the interaction short and look for more receptive women, instead.

Just to give you an idea, you **shouldn’t expect more than 10% of the women you approach to be interested in you.**

- If you meet a girl early in the day, feel free to call in the evening, otherwise call her next day
- When making plans for the date, be precise when it comes to day, time, and place
- Meet her as early as possible, so she has time to come back to your place

###### To Get Into the Lover’s Vibe, Talk to Her As If You’re Lovers
Treat the girl as if you two already had sex. 

Girl will follow your lead, treat you the same way, you will bond and connect more quickly, and sex is much more likely to happen.

###### Quotes
> Seduction isn’t making someone do what they don’t want to do. Seduction is enticing someone into doing what they secretly want to do already.
