> Women **love** sex.

Whether a woman will sleep with a man quickly depends on a variety of factors. Sum up in two: her side and his side.

#### Her Side
Women have four typical “modes”
- Distracted / Unsocial / Highly Reserved
- Party Time
- Find a Boyfriend
- Get Intimate


##### Distracted / Unsocial / Highly Reserved
These are each different modes, but give the result for a man interested in a girl. *This is one of the two unreceptive modes a woman can be in*.
- **Distracted**:  has a lot going on and many things to do so she is closed off to interruptions and is not trying to meet new people or hold a conversation.
- **Unsocial**:  not feeling like meeting anyone, or worse, is in a negative / non-constructive mood, such as being very sad ,depressed, or angry.
- **Highly Reserved**: variety of reason
	- a girl who is less sociable and in a committed relationship,  will be very reserved and quite closed to meeting new people (*sociable women, even when committed, remain sociable and outgoing*). 
	- social rule:
		- in in South Korea, there is social pressure against woman to talk foreign men in very public places 
		- Italian women tend to be more shy than women from many other cultures,
		- ...
##### Party Time
A girl is in party mode if she’s dancing wildly, talking excitedly with her girlfriends, and generally bouncing around in a very bubbly, high energy state.
Most common during night life.
The mistake is thinking women who are partying hard are easy and looking to have fast relations.  But party mode, is the other unreceptive mode category.

> Women who are partying are out to have fun – not to meet new lovers

WHY: party mode is about a girl letting loose, dancing freely with her girlfriends.
She just want fun and frivolty.

HOWEVER: can get her is you the MOST fun of the place (*have to be awesome*).


##### Find a Boyfriend
They are the most picky women out there when it comes to selecting men.

Women on a boyfriend hunt tend to be stingy with intimacy – they don’t want to give up intimacy too quickly and risk looking like they’re too easy. So instead, they’ll hold out on sleeping with a man for a while as they position themselves for a relationship.

=> need more work to become intimate with. 

NOTE: they may become quit alarming about intimacy and stop it all as she got scare of rejection and [attainability] -> so calm her down and reasure her. 

##### Get Intimate
some woman just want to meet a man and sleep quickly (many reason).

note: if look boyfriend material, she may take it slowly, cause she is scared to ruin it. 


##### Multiple modes
Mixte of all the previous mode.


### His side
simple: 
- be attractive
- move thing forward
- close the deal
