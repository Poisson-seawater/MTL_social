Talk, ask her information then plan a date.


WHEN: at the highest point of the conversation 
WHY: 
- usually you ask information before leaving.  -> conversation dying, can feel weird.
- SO ask at high point, it show I like to stay with people who bring good things into my life. 

HOW to ask: 
- **do**: 
	- “Let’s stay in touch. How do I get hold of you?” 
	- "Let me grab your contact info before I forget.”
- don't: "what's your number" -> she heard it thousand of time. AND they are  compliance requests + use the word “number” (*over-used in her past*)
	- AND makes you look and sound weak, puts the woman into the position of needing to make a decision. 


###### keeping number:
- Put her info in your phone – you do it, or have her do it
- Next, call her phone
- Then, have her save your number

couple of things to check:
1. Seeing your number on her phone lets you know that you got the right number
2. Seeing her how she answer and save your number will give you an idea how serious she is about you.
	1. If she saves your number, and makes sure she has your name spelled properly, you’ll know she’s interested and wants to hear from you again.

###### WOMAN and DECISION:
Women tend to follow the path of least resistance, and if the case is anything other than that she simply cannot wait to see you again, it’s going to be easier for her to decide on inaction (“No”) rather than action  (“Okay”). 
Women look to men to lead and decide; furthermore, if she clearly likes you, she is going to assume that you’ll take her information. If a man she had previously assumed would just take her information then asks her if he can have it, she’s going to have to pause and reassess her assumption: “Hmm… can he have it? That’s a good question!”


#### Other Kinds of Contact Information
- Email
	- maybe she travel a lot. If personal email -> good. 
- Social Networking
	- => polite decline. Say you don't have then bid her farewell -> move on. 
- Business Cards
	- check for her personal number if not, ask for it.
