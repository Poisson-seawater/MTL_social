It's the unhelpfull frame. Knowing that frame only work when someone believe in it by doing such things are: surrender or fighting it.
THEN the best way is to ignore it. 

Exemple: woman saying they are not having sex, a man might choose to:
- Smile deviously, and draw her in for a passionate kiss.
	- => Ignoring 
- Joke with her by reframing himself as the one who is making her wait: “You’re damn right we’re not having sex tonight. What do you take me for? I’m not that easy.”
	- -> reframing
- Call her out on the thought and point out to her the way her mind is going: “Sex? Who said anything about sex? I was just thinking about what wine we should have. What’s on your mind?”
	- Good one cause it puts the woman in a position of having to own up internally to where her head was at, because it’s true. 

It’s incredibly important that you remain in control – she wants it that way, and you want it that way. It’s best for everyone.
