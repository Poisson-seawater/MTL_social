The middle part of the interaction is where you will begin using chase frames, and where women will begin to really realize your value (*beyond the fundamentals*).

Begin using chase frames and using subtle nonverbal signals to imply that a woman is chasing you, it begins to set in her mind that in fact she is . And once she begins to believe it, she will begin to act it.

NOTE: for rapid seduction, deep conversation can be contreproductive (she just want a one night stand).

#### Signs a Woman is Chasing You, and How to Use Them
-> Law of Least Effort

maintain a balance where women are putting in perhaps 10 or 20% more effort than you are – but not too much more, or you risk them auto-rejecting. 
 [[Signs that a woman is interested and pursuing]]

###### Why not rewarding her interest
Unlike good behavior in general, most of these you will not be directly rewarding.
Because reward are for reaction to something you have done, or a request you’ve made. If reward her for compliance it give the feeling that you are overeager to receive signs of interest from your girl.

Instead, you will make a mental note of signs of interest coming from the woman you are speaking with, and will maintain that interest through attainability tech and by showing some interest of your own. However, you want to be careful not to overdo it – show just enough that she realizes she is succeeding in her pursuit of you, and getting closer to her goal. The idea is to help her feel closer without feeling as though she has “achieved” you.


WHY leaving the "intrigue"?? Cause all the **fun and pleasure** coming from the game of seduction take place from the *intrigue -> not being sure she had you*.  SO HAVE TO KEEP THE CHALLENGE !!
WHEN does she had you? Kiss, intimate, make her your girlfriend...


#### Encouraging Chasing
A woman needs to feel good when she pursues you

###### 3 scenario to illustrate chasing:
1. the woman you pursue never acknowledges your efforts or attempts. 
	1. She seems largely oblivious to them, in fact. -> SO you stop cause she is not interested in you
2. the woman you pursue being warm or flirtatious, making you feel good as you pursue, and as though you are getting somewhere – although she never goes absolutely crazy for you. 
	1. You can tell that she likes you and you feel like you’re getting somewhere. How does your pursuit change as it progresses? Well, you probably feel like you have a legitimate shot and work harder, right?
3. you pursue a woman who suddenly starts throwing herself at you, acting overly excited and taking charge with fervor after you express some interest. 
	1. What’s your reaction to her? I’m betting she very likely scares you off with this behavior (if you have any common sense!).

=> Goldilock rule and attainability, just the middle. 


###### [[To give her encouragement]]:
1. Flirting with her: Being charming, sexy, and seductive. 
	1. Using innuendoes, suggestion, and chase frames that hint at or imply the two of you getting together. 
		1. throught voice tone and nonverbal communication.
2. Going into deep rapport with her: 
	1. Get her woman to open up with intimate details about her past, childhood, dreams, and relationships
3. Leading her. 
	1. Women respond to leading as a sign of interest. 
		1.  will make her feel closer to you and rewarded.
4. Escalating with her physically.
	2. Touching her in
		1. an increasingly intimate manner 
		2. and just plain touching her more (*more physical contact, more constant contact*)
