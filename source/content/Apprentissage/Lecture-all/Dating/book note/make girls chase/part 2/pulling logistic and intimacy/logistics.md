#### Your Location
How easy is it to get women you’ve met in your favorite places back to your place?
->  [[Transition Points]]


#### Logistics on the Fly
Alternative to your place: 
- Her place (check to see if she has roommates / her own room first)
- Hotel / motel room
- Back seat of your or her car
- Park bench
- Beach
- Dark alley or stairwell
- Bathroom

Getting intimate in an unusual locale can often be easier, because most women lack prior experiences in these – and thus, feel less pressure and resistance to becoming intimate in such places + excitation of something new.
