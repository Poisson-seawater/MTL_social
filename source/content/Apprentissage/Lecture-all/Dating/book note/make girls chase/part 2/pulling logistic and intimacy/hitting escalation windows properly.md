#SurfPhilosophy/dating/Chase 

Signe you missed the escalation windows: "“Hey, it was great to meet you, but I’ve ... -> she leave".

Escalation windows are: 
- telling her to sit near you
- invite her to go somewhere with less people
- make a move -> kiss her

> Promise yourself that the moment you get the feeling that you’ve been in one spot too long, or it starts feeling a little awkward, you will push to move things forward



When a girl gives you that space – or worse, when she makes a move or says something to suggest that she wants you to start moving on the seduction – you must take it as a clear sign you need to act; then, act. Women will tell you what they want and it’s your job as the man to listen and to fulfill their desires.

#### Recovering From Missed Windows
Once an escalation window is missed, a woman will tend to resent the man who missed it, thinking of him both as weak, and as a man who doesn’t know what she wants

If you’ve missed a window, focus mostly on attainability when attempting to restore attraction. Go easy on chase frames.
Get attainability back up again, show her that you care and are interested in her, and then begin restoring sexual value with chase frames once attainability is restored.
