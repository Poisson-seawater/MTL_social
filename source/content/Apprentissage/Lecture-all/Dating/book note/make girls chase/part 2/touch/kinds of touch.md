[[more on touch]]

Kind of touch: 
- [[Incidental Touch]]:
	- Do lightly and throughout a conversation as mostly a social function; for instance, touching a girlâ€™s elbow on a high point, or sitting next to her with your legs touching hers.
- [[Protective Touch]]: 
	- To protect or guiding a woman, such as placing your hand on her lower back while guiding her through a crowd
- [[Romantic Touch]]: 
	- More intimate touch that you do as the interaction progresses to physically signal your interest. This can include things like briefly stroking her chin or cheek, or playing with her hair, or holding her hands.
- [[Sexual Touch]]: 
	- Touch that stimulates a woman sexually. Generally, wait until the two of you are in private. It includes stroking her inner thighs and kissing her neck.


WHEN strong eye contact and mischievous smile, THEN go to her, take her hand, make her do a dance turn and go into close position.
