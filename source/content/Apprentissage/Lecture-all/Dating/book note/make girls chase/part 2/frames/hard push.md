It's an extreme persistence that surprisingly produces results, and it goes back to our initial premise that no one is 100% certain of his or her stance.
*Ex: that persistance vendor that keep bodering you until you give up and buy something.* 

It works less for men but for women they tend to have a very different reaction – they feel a surge of attraction. Women are attracted to men who get them to do things to go against what they’d previously decided to do. Because, if she’s going to change her mind for this man, he must be a very strong, very dominant man, and she will feel attracted to him.
-> you know you succeed when you see her eye change (*like a puppy eye*).
=> Have to keep giving her new reason use both logical and non logical (context to choose but use as statue quo logical). 



*think about the girl that ended up with this guys cause he kept trying, persistance is a trait woman like*
