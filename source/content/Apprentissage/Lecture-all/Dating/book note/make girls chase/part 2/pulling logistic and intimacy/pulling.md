### Pulling
vs [[hard push]]
Once you’ve moved a girl a little and escalated her level of investment and perhaps built a connection with her, you should start thinking about pulling. It's NOT a timer, it's a gut feeling.

When pulling, it’s essential to have the right mentality. Women can sense neediness and uncertainty, and it unnerves them.
-> just invite her home. 

> Pull every woman you like who is following your lead and investing. You might be surprised which women get intimate with you, and how quickly.


SIDE NOTE: You will never “master” opening, or any other part of seduction. There is always more to learn. Focus on learning the complete process, rather than just parts of it.
