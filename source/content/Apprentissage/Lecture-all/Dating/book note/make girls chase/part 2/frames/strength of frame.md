## Strengh of frame
Your frame will naturally grow stronger and more solid as you become increasingly seasoned in the social arts. BUT you need to know yourself !!!

It's your frame that allow you to succeed the girls challenge.
[[responding to challenges|When challenge, different way of answering ]]
- [[Challenging]] a woman back (playfully, ideally).
- Remaining calm and [[Dismissal|dissmissing]] the comment.
- Responding with [[Self-Deprecation]].
- Responding with an [[Invitational|invitation]].
- Answering [[Matter-of-Fact with Undertones|matter-of-factly]] but with strong undertones.
- BAD one: 
	- Qualifying, or submitting under pressure.
	- Bristling under pressure and arguing.

=> rule of thumbs for answering challenge like a man who“seen it all” and is never surprised, amazed, or overwhelmed. -> Law of Least Effort

SO Shrug off challenges, -> it discourages her from challenging you again, while boosting your perceived value.
