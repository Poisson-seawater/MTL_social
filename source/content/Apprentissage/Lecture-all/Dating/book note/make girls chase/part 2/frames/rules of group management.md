Hard cause group are most jugementfull toward stranger than their own member.
BUT it's a good skill to practice.

First, you need to develop the ability to re**cognize the leader** of the group and 
- get on her side 
- or stay out of her way. 


The leader is generally going to be the one exhibiting the following behavior:
- Talking the loudest
- Being the center of attention
- Interrupting others
- Accepting and rejecting ideas 
- Arguing with others and shooting down opinions she doesn’t agree with
- Passing judgment on new people entering the group
- most energetic

IF the leader accepts you in the group, the rest of the group will accept you as well.


Once you know the leader, trade a few pleasantries and a bit of small talk to at least seem likeable. Talk briefly with other members of the group as well.


**When cold approaching groups, cold approach the girl you like best**. Women are going to expect you to go for the woman you like best, and many girls will see you as “the guy” of whatever girl you start talking to. 
It doesn’t always work this way, especially if you seem like you’re out of the league of the girl you start talking to, you may get more attractive / higher status girls in the group competing for you, because they know their friend doesn’t really stand a chance with you. 

Also important in groups is to focus your attention on the girl you like best. Talk with others, but don’t get into deep conversation with them. Keep your conversation with other members of the group light and small talky, and save the deep connecting for the girl you like. Take opportunities where she talks as opportunities to spark conversation between the two of you, as well.

IF you’ve done a good job spreading good cheer among the other friends by making polite, friendly small talk and expressing friendly interest without going too deep, the friends will all think of you as a cool, very-okay kind of guy, and they’ll end up leaving the two of you alone while you and the girl you like immerse yourselves in good conversation.

One cardinal rule of managing groups: focus on one person at a time. 
IF you treat a group as a single entity and address the group, or talk to “you guys,” people will quickly lose interest in what you’re saying, because they don’t feel like it’s for them. You must address individuals within a group, one at a time.
