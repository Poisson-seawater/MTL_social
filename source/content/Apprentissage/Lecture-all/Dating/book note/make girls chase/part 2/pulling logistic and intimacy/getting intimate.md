Once you have a woman alone with you, you must make a move, and in most cases, you want to make it as soon as possible – ideally, within the first five to ten minutes of having her alone with you.
-> unless she need some time to get confortable.


When a man waits to make his first move, it does two things:
1. It places an unreasonable amount of pressure on him (and the girl!) as they wait for the inevitable move to be made.
2. It places an unreasonable burden of import upon that first move, and when he finally makes it, it will feel huge to both him and the girl. Many times, she will feel something akin to, “Okay, that’s enough for tonight!” because it felt so significant, since it had so much buildup behind it. She will move to end the evening with him and save more for next time.).



#### Emotional Escalation
Emotional escalation is getting a woman to the point that she is fully ready for intimacy.

The basic tenants of emotional escalation are that you want to avoid anything that will make a girl get overly defensive: 
- dirty talk (unless you already know she like this)
- thinking about future event or anything that sound boyfriend

BEST ADVICE Keep your mouth mostly shut during escalation – it’s the best way to ensure the escalation proceeds smoothly. 

Also, she may say think and act differently. 
-> she need to make her hard to get
=> As always with woman: listen to her actions, not her words.

#### Physical Escalation
It is best to skip the shirt and bra, and go straight for the pants. Most women’s pants and panties come off much more easily when their shirts and bras are still on. Since most men don’t take this path, women have far less automatic responses built up. 

While kissing a woman, you will tend to want to focus on stimulating her vaginally.
Wait for her to get her to take her bra off OR for intimacy.

Physical escalation tends to be somewhat  easier while under bed covers; if you can pull covers up over you, many women will lower their guards a bit and move more quickly and with less resistance toward intimacy. They feel safer and more protected from prying eyes even in a bedroom behind closed doors.
