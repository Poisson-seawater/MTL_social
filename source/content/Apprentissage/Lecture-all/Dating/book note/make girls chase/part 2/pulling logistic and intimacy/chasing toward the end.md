When stop letting a girl chase him and just go for her ? To soon and you end up acting incongruent with your previous behavior; to late and you risk to lose the woman due to lack of physical escalation. 

WHAT TO DO: never stop being pursued. 
During escalation you can remain the pursued, by doing things like pulling women into you and continuing to use verbal chase frames as you escalate.
-> You do the physical escalation, but use chase frames verbally to position her as the pursuer; *"I thought we were just going to hang out and talk"*. 


WHY: Women are taught that intimacy that happens too quickly is bad and that they should postpone it as long as possible, except with men they are only going to sleep with once and never see again. By engaging their logic through framing them as the pursuers, they are freed from the constraints of such socially-imposed constraints, allowing them to follow their own desires for you.
