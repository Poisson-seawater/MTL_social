You will be the one approaching women and initially engaging them.
1. When you pre-open, 
	1. touch a woman and have her turn toward you and make eye contact with you first, before speaking to her or even returning eye contact to her. 
	2. -> You set a small, almost imperceptible [[frames]] that implies she is almost opening you.
2. This continues through the initial stage of the interaction, as you engage while taking the more relaxed body language and locking in. 
	1. You may also adopt a slightly bored tone of voice, which makes women work a bit harder in general to keep your attention and keep you impressed. 
	2. Check for women who position themselves near you and facing directly toward you; they are almost opening you themselves. 
		1. With women like this, you can simply extend a hand and pull them into you, 
		2. OR you can open them very casually with something like, “And how’s your night going?” You basically imply that you caught them hovering around you, and you are bringing them into the conversation they were angling for.
