If communicate by text or mail.

In person easier: non verbal and can rectify the shoot.

When distance interactions, put a priority on building a positive, rewarding experience for a woman while simultaneously using subtle verbal chase frames. She should always enjoy talking to you, and you should deftly sever negative or destructive conversational threads.
*Example: Hey, Kelly, stop thinking about me naked all the time,” and she’ll laugh and find it a little bit exciting*.

One thing to keep in mind about chase frames in general: they tend to take a woman close to the point of auto-rejection, then back away.
It’s one of the reasons why we keep moving after delivering the chase frame – so a woman doesn’t have a chance to begin auto-rejecting. This dynamic is changed slightly over slow communication media such as text messaging and email. Here, you can still use chase frames, but use them more as a seasoning instead of a main course. So a text exchange might look like:
- Guy: Hey miss marbles. Thinking about grabbing some kebab in an hour – you should come with if you’re not otherwise engaged. Girl: I can’t, I have salsa tonight. Wish I could, I love kebab!
- Guy: Sorry I can’t be there to dance with you, but I’m scared you’d grab my ass and embarrass me in front of the salsa people.
- Guy: Maybe just a little. Don’t tell your instructor, I don’t want him to get jealous.
	- *securing the chase frame, but also implying that other men want her too – win-win for both of them*
- Girl: I won’t. We should hang out soon!
- Guy: Definitely. I want to see some of your new moves ;) Have fun at salsa.
	- *valuing something she takes pride in*
- Girl: I will =) Enjoy your kebab.


> After a chase frame, build a woman up so she feels good and enjoys the experience (*see note in Italic*)

NOTE: Better to play things a little more conservatively by text than you might in-person.
