One main issues is comming to friendly -> candidature for friend NOT for boyfriend nor lover.

Chase framing will facilitate in removing you from the “friends” category, and escalating intimacy and investment will do the rest. 
-> [[what women value]] for friend vs. boyfriend vs. lover caracteristic
**However**, you’re still faced with the boyfriend dilemma.

#### boyfriend dilemma
The more you improve yourself and your skills, the more you raise your desirability to women as a boyfriend, and the more they tend to want to develop a secure commitment -> waiting.

To navigate the boyfriend dilemma – *something you’ll want to do, even if you want to be a girl’s boyfriend* – you’ll need to do a better job disqualifying yourself as a boyfriend. 

Social beginner should keep being a boyfriend candidate. 
IF a social veteran is with a girl he cares for, it is important to maintain this feeling of uncertainty in her. 
-> to do so: long vague speech about life is incertain, you like her and spending time with her, respect her and don't want to lie to her. AND agains life is uncertain cause travel, ambition...
###### Sentence to disqualify yourself as a potential boyfriend:
- Let her know you have a girlfriend or are in a relationship
- Let her know you’re newly out of a relationship and still recovering and not looking to get involved
- Let her know you’re on travel and only in town another night or two
- Let her know you’re moving out of town and will be far away
- Let her know you have all kinds of friends in your life, but that when it comes to serious dating, you usually only date girls of XYZ race / nationality / hair color (something different than her)
- Let her know you’re not really all that sure about relationships anymore, and not even sure you want to have another one (in a very neutral, non-negative / non-pessimistic way)
