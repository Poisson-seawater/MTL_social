#SurfPhilosophy/dating/Chase 

-> follow up soon rule of thumb is few hour after meeting telling her it was great to meet her, ending by signing your name.

WHY:
1. It reminds her of you and gets her thinking about you while the memory of you is still fresh in her head.
2. It “breaks the ice” on communicating via text and phone, allowing her to contact you more easily, and making it more natural and expected the next time you contact her.
3. It gives her your name, just in case she’s forgotten it. A woman might have really loved meeting you, but if she forgot your name might be too embarrassed to respond to you again.


##### The First Phone Call
Next day is good.

IF you wait a few days to call a girl who really liked you, she might be a little happier to hear from you if you wait a few days vs. had you called her the very next day. But the benefit is small, if any.
On the other hand, for a girl you had a fairly neutral interaction with, her memory is better now than latter.

don't plan a meeting on the 1st phone call. Give her the opportunity to enjoy talking to you, but not know if / when you are planning to ask her out.

Let her ask you out during the first or second phone conversation, or hint that the two of you should meet sometime soon.
Once that happens, girls are chasing after you, and you’re right where you want to be.

###### for that initial phone call:
- **Walk around** or use some distraction to calm the nerves.
- **Plan your greeting**.
- **Have a story at the ready**: Something **short** and **interesting** that happened to you recently; ideally since the last time you spoke with the girl you’re calling. It doesn’t have to be anything amazing
- **Keep a time limit in mind** 10 to 15min top
- **Plan your exit**


##### Texting
You should rely on phone calls for cementing connections and setting up dates, until you’ve gotten your texting game equal to call.

Cause texting, have only one disadvantage: bad emotion convey.


Rule for texting:
- **Keep texts short** -> Law of Least Effort
	- your communication should be  the same length as what she is giving you in return, and ideally will be slightly shorter. -> she is chasing after you
- **Avoid questions as first texts** – especially boring questions.
	- like "How was your day" -> imply 
		1. you has nothing better to do than thinking about the her and texting her 
			1. => *his life must be uneventful 
			2. => she knows she has you now
		2. IF the question goes unanswered, it’s negative precedent for investment,
		3. communicates the you have nothing better to say
- **Keep messages fun**: Either talk about fun, cool, interesting things going on with you, or tease your girl a little bit.
	- She should enjoy getting texts from you and look forward to it. But not over the top -> trying to build a rapport and set up a date
- **Keep your eye on the ball**. <=> the date
	- You should have a direction you’re moving with your text messages – forward, towards a date.
	- IF you’re texting aimlessly or having long text message conversations, you’re doing it wrong – and moving too slow. -> remember: too slow -> she auto-reject


##### Arranging the Meet


###### Your Place – Ideal
IF she is into you and is pushing for the meet hard herself THEN your place. 


Have some good music (like Thievery Corporation or Sade), a few candles, and a wellset up home – ideally have the only places to sit be your bed and a small couch or loveseat that lets you be physically close with your woman. You can stack boxes and a little dirty laundry (might sound gross, but she won’t touch dirty laundry, whereas pillows she might move! If you don’t want to go that route, maybe put a stack of really heavy books there) on the couch to take up room if it’s too big – you want to avoid the awkward situation of you sitting down on one end and her sitting down on the other. Physical proximity is tantamount, both for her getting comfortable with you, and for you
initiating kissing and physical escalation.

When she first arrives, have her take her shoes off at the door. Sinceshe has now removed an article of clothing (the shoes), and is making a commitment to stay a while – and hand her the matches or the lighter and have her light the candles, so she is participating in the seduction from the beginning. -> investment purpose

Other tips: try making her come, then leave the appartment and come again. Like you do some groceries shopping for cooking. -> Make her feel like she have been there multiple times already. 

###### Somewhere Casual Near You – Next Best Thing to Your Place
IF she is pushing for a coffey or something else
THE you want her to pick you up – tell her to swing by your address and the two of you will ride together
- IFit’s a very short walking distance, tell her to come by and you’ll meet at your home or building and head out.


WHY:
- avoid **Women flake** -> she don't show up
- **Her coming to your place is investment.**
	- + she get familiar to your place
	- Never underestimate the value of getting women familiar with places, scenarios, and ideas whenever possible (that’s also a large benefit of chase framing – getting them accustomed to and comfortable with the thought of intimacy with you).

DATE PLAN: go for a walk to a park or the beach then head back to your place for a movie or a drink.

###### Scenarios to Avoid
- Bar / Nightclub / Party: to many think from male concurence to her friend
	- can: once you had sex 4 to 5 time with her. 
- Long travel times: except if it's her place
- Expensive dates: Keep your dates cheap – contrary to what many men think, the more you pay for a woman, the harder it is to get intimate with her later
- Group activities: for being her friend only


###### Date template
- Informational Date.
	- IF can tell is not very comfortable with you yet. Schedule something very light and casual with her – lunch, coffee or ice cream.
	- After you’ve spent some time together (1h - 2h), let her know you enjoyed talking to her, and end the date.
	- IF happen really well, invite her for a drink or cooking
- Structured Date.
	- The gist is set up a number of steps to the date so that the two of you do different things, and end up at your place. Example:
		- Have a girl meet you at your place, or pick you up there
		- grab coffee or ice cream
		- do a fun activity – comedy show, cinema?, beach, walk in the parc
		-  head back to your place
		- Make dinner or drinks as necessary
		- Get intimate
- Easy Date
	- go to your place for dinner or a drink, plan to go out latter. 
		- -> but never go out ;)
	- for girl who is reasonably confortable with you

##### His routine date
- Meet a girl and talk to her briefly and tell her we should meet up and grab her cell number.
- Get right to it and text her within a day or so to meet up – something close to, “Hey Sarah, let’s grab that bite! When are you free over the next couple of days?”
- Find out her availability and tell her to meet me at my subway stop.
- Meet here there on the day of and take her to a little café very near my apartment.
- Talk to her for one to two hours and have a bite to eat.
- After our food is finished, tell her to come home with me.

##### Dealing with Flakes
pick times and dates that are convenient and make sure everything is kept simple so no mental effort to meet you.


texte an hour or 2 before with something like: 
- Hey xx! When you get here, let’s meet at Exit B. See you soon!
- Xx, running a little behind. Okay to meet at 11:30 instead of 11?

WHY: 
1. It reassures your girl that you’re coming – just like you, girls worry about flakes too, and she’s a lot less likely to flake herself if she’s confident you’ll show up.
2. Gives her an opening to let you know she’s going to flake. 


IF she flake: make sure she understands it’s no big deal, and dismiss any effort she makes to explain herself. Then a few days later, see about rescheduling.
WHY, most guys do this *(and we are different)*:
- Freak out and try to punish the girl for wasting their time, or
- Act like a pushover and say it’s fine while still exuding discomfort.

WHY 2: IF you get angry and freak out, she’s not going to want to meet you. If you give her bad emotions and make her feel guilty for not showing up, she’s not going to want to meet you. If she feels like your time was wasted and you were uncomfortable, she’s not going to want to meet you.
