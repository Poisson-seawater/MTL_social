A man who can make a woman feel
genuinely good is the rarest of men. Most men just make women feel used, insecure, intimidated, or resented.

Be the guys that to look into a woman’s eyes and give her excitement and fun. as he is the most uncommon of men out there, and women pursue these men. 
Be a man who genuinely loves and cares for women, and who genuinely loves making them happy.

NOTE if you provide too many good feelings to a woman, she can come to fear the risk of intimacy and the risk of losing you and the good feelings you provide should things not work out. Any time someone comes to value something in its present state too much, they’ll fight against any changes that might affect it.
-> Goldilock concept: Give women enough that they feel great whenever they’re around you, but not so much that you solve all their problems and make their life wonderful before the two of you are physically together.


#### Good Feeling Substitution
It's when you trade one type of good feeling
for another. This includes:
- Attention
- Bonding
- Dancing
- Movies
- Intimacy


So if a girl gets her fill of good feelings from one of these avenues, her need for any of the others goes down substantially. Which means, if you were about to take a girl home and bed her, and you took her dancing instead, she may very well no longer feel the need to go back with you and get physical after she’s had her fill of dancing. But it also means the opposite is true; if a girl really wants to dance her heart out, and you convince her to come home with you instead, she’s quite likely to get intimate with you in search of the thrill, excitement, and good feelings she desires.

-> This makes it vitally important to not over provide good feelings prior to intimacy.


#### Fun
Same reason you want to avoid the fun entertainer guy. 
BUT You’re not with a woman to provide fun for her; you’re with her to excite her with your presence and make her lust for you. She should want to start chasing you as soon as she has any degree of contact with you or even on sight; being fun will defuse that.
