-> kind of like [[hard push]]

To fight last minute resistance for : you throw a bunch of logical reasons so it is overwhelmingly logical that she come with you or whatever. 

Exemple
Her: I’m just really tired. I’m going to head back I think.
You: No, look. I like you; we’re getting along so well, having a lot of fun together, and if you head back now and I head back now we might never even get to see each other again. We can go for 30 minutes and go sit get to know each other one-on-one and not have to worry about what all these other people are doing. Let’s just do like we originally planned and we’ll go to sleep a little later; we can always sleep, but we can’t always meet such an amazing new person.
