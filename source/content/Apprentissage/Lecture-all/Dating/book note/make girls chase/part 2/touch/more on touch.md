difference between a flirt and a closer i touch.
- Flirts don’t touch much or touch in “friendly” ways.
- Closers touch in warm, intimate, and exciting way


three subsets of men:
- Guys who don’t touch.
- Guys who touch, but don’t know the right way to touch.
	- woman refer to them when complain men touch too much. 
- Guys who touch, and do it in sexually exciting ways

Touch closes the gap of awkward tension that exists between a man and a woman when there is interest or attraction that isn’t being satisfied through conversation alone.



Touch is natural for all human, IF she come to a culture without touch and protest "don't touch me". Check for non-verbal -> pull her closer and/or hug her -> Check for non-verbal.


=> all the rule of touch are to be try and find my way. Such as the kissing rule.
