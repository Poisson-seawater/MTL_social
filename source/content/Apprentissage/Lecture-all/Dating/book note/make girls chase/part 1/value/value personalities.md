three basic kinds of Value:
- value neutral
- value giver
- value taker

#### value neutral
Most people are considered value neutral until you’re in an interaction with them. Like
- the cute girl in the room
- the well dress man

Once someone’s in an interaction, they stop being value neutral. At that point, they are either contributing to or taking away from the interaction.


#### value giver
> It's who you want to be.

It's about 
- talking with interesting things and welcome advice to share, 
- being a good listeners that people want to talk to, 
	- making feel other happy that you are paying attention to them.

Most appreciated is the social value – people who know how to make other people feel good and feel included and have fun. They bring positive, supportive, upbeat energy, great ideas, suggestions, and advice, and are deft at mitigating negative situations, and build up the people around them

#### value taker
It's a person that most people don’t want around.

It's people who 
- take value tend to complain, 
- come across as needy or dependent, 
- or glom onto a group of other people without offering anything that group wants.

Other characteristics of value takers are
- that they lack conversational topics, 
- are critical and not very good listeners, 
	- and are almost always very closed-minded and dismissive. 
- They make people feel bad about their thoughts, ideas, suggestions, and lives.
