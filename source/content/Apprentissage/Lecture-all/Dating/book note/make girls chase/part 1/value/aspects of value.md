##### SHOW VALUE - what looser say
The: "If she doesn’t want me, too bad for her, she
doesn’t know what she’s missing"
IS AN EXCUSE. 
This mean: 
- you fail to express your quality !!! -> bad honest marketing

SO to shift girls out of neutral to  interested, two must do: 
- Help them see (perceive) your value
- Help them realize they can attain you – and the value you provide

### Show Value
Perception (of your value) is based on many things – fact, fiction, and everything in-between.
-> don't lie, if want Long-terme with her; cause it's destroy reliability and trust!!!

Be honest with women – it frees you
- from the sticky situations that accompany lying, and 
-  from feeling like you always need to impress them

Value is what gets your foot in the door and helps you further the rest of the interaction. To succed you need to follow the **process**. 
CAUSE: process is how you separate yourself from the 2000 guys just like you out there. 

> The better you become the more you need to show less and less value !!!


power of perception, and the power of value. You can show a woman whatever aspect of yourself you want her to see – and she do the same.


#### [[attainability]]
For a woman to subscribe to your value, is also a result of whether she feel she can get you.

things that can make you seem out of reach,
- Being too aloof
- Being rude, angry, or short
- **Failing to tell a girl what you like about her and show her you appreciate her**
- Failing to come across as [genuine]
- Failing to move quickly enough in an interaction
- Failing to reward good behavior and contributions
