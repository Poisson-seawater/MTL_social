**Compliance Stacking** using a single piece of compliance to lead seamlessly and immediately into multiple subsequent investments.

An example of compliance stacking might be screening a girl in a nightclub, and then motioning for her to lean in closer to you so that you may hear her. 
- Her working to pass the screen is the first piece of compliance; 
- her leaning in closer to you so you might hear is the second.
