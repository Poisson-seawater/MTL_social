#### Screening
3 purposes:
1. It gets women to invest.
2. It helps you determine if the woman you are screening is the kind of woman you’re looking for.
3. It lets women see that you have standards

=> [[Screening and Compliance]]

###### Why standard matter
If you go to RH and they just look at your resum then say "You are hire". Won't you thing:
- "you are letting anyone in aren't you??" or 
- they are desesperate

BUT: the best RH ask simple question then approve you; and when you leave you are super motivate to work. 

###### Screening is about
How you communicate to a woman that
you have standards, and show her you’re viewing her as someone special. Cause you are getting to know her and recognizes what great qualities she
have, how awesome and unique she is...

###### Pattern of screening
general pattern is:
- Screen
- Listen to her response (known as “qualifying” when she seeks to live up to your standards)
- Reward her for a good qualifying response
