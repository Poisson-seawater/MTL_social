#### Attainability
**Attainability** is a measurement of how accessible your value is to women – how realistically they think they can get you.
-> *once one made enought money, he may think about owning a Yatch.*

***Consequence***: If it seems unattainable to us, we naturally do not see its value. People only tend to desire things they think, believe, and perceive that they can get.


=> Attainability is knowing and feeling like you can get something, and it won't disappear for no good reason.
It's a feeling most people aren't aware of. 


### Recognizing attainability problems
How to tell the difference between a value, investment, & an attainability problem.

#### Value problems
-> [[aspects of value]]

<=> guy’s failure to do an adequate job of conveying what a high value guy he is.
HENCE: woman will be sweet to him but not interested.

two cue:
- Women are very nice to him, in a kind of motherly way.
- Women are obviously very unemotionally invested in him – they don't get emotionally worked up around him, whether that's intrigued, or attracted, or angry, or anything. They're kind, but indifferent.

#### Investment Problems
Investment problems come in two flavors: precedence and escalation.
- Precedence, refers to your past history with any one particular girl on investment.
	- IF know her since a while, when start creating investment, she may thought: "this isn’t a guy I do stuff for!”
	- IF just meet her; she'll think nothing of it and knows that's how you are and what you expect.
	- Escalation: too much too soon. 

SOLUTION: rotate back down to lower levels of compliance and build back up.

#### Attainability Problems
Remember the 3 questions about attainability:
1. Is this for real?
2. Can a girl like me get a guy like him?
3. Does he respect me as a friend?
