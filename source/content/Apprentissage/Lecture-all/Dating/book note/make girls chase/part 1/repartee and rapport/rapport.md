Rapport is how you move things forward. Once you’ve hooked her enough with a little repartee, you can work towards getting to know her. 

Rapport is where the components of attraction emerge, they are: 
- **[[value]]** as what you have to offer a woman; 
	- emerges either by being directly stated or through being “discovered”
- **[[investment]]** as the level of commitment 
	- initiated by your new female acquaintance as well.
- **[[effort]]** she has put and is continuing to put into an interaction with you; 
- and **[[attainability]]** as how readily a woman feels she can access your value.
	- is to be actively managed by you.

#### Deep Rapport and Cementing Emotion
Get in the habit of stating or pointing out what a woman is feeling to her, to cement the emotion in her mind and aid her recalling it later.

Exemple:  “That… is the biggest smile I’ve ever seen. It’s a lovely smile, actually. You’re lovely.” 
Here there is cementing + positif reinforcment of smile near you.
