##### Walk
two great types of walk:
- The Gunslinger Walk
- The Male Model Walk

characteristics in common:
- The walk is straight, with very little movement in the hips / buttocks.
- Both feet are placed facing straight forward, one in front of the other – never splayed out to the side.
- There is a distinct, masculine movement of the shoulders / upper body in rhythm with the walk.


Gunslinger is done more slowly and with a slightly wider stance, comes across as tougher / stronger. 
the Male Model is done more quickly with a more closed stance, comes across as more elegant / fashionable.
