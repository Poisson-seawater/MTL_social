#### Conversation style
Men and women simply have different ways of communicating. Men tend to find the female conversational style frustrating – and women tend to find the male conversational style clumsy and boring.


##### Male Conversation style
The typical male conversational style is logical, straightforward, and practical. It’s most useful for conveying information.
Only when a speaker has finished and made his point may someone else speak; and interrupting is really rude. 

##### Femal Conversation style
The female conversational style is emotional, roundabout, and focused on what is going on and being felt in the moment. 

The role of speaker is more fluid and less defined.
Typically, there is one person speaking, while listeners interrupt with expressions of relation (to show that they are on the same page, and “getting”, or relating to, the speaker’s point). Listeners will even jump excitedly into the conversation to begin sharing their own story, related to the speaker’s, cutting the speaker off before he or she had reached the end of the story.

This is because the whole point of thefemale conversational style is relating, and one of the best ways to relate to someone else is to declare, “I know exactly what you mean – listen, the same thing just happened to me!”

emphasis  is on sharing emotions and experiences.

##### Using conversation style
Learning to more effectively relate and convey emotions and feelings will make your conversation much more accessible to and engaging for women.

Let people come and relate to your story. Even let them change the subject. As long as an emotion or experience is shared.
