#### I, You and We
The distribution of I, You, and We in a person’s conversation, tell what he or she is most focused on.

A natural back-and-forth conversation between two people tends to have a nearly even distribution of I's and You's.

"We” is a powerful word in its own right. You don’t want to use it too early into an interaction. But once the two of you have established a certain level of relation to each other, begin using “we” as much as you can without overdoing it.
-> make her think of you as a "us"
