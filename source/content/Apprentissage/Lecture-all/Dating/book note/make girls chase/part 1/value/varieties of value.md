Learn to switch your value depending of what the woman is looking for.

Variety of Value:
- friend
- boyfriend
- husband
- lover

note: if you are inbetween category, then she may repeal you.

#### friend
Friends are cool, fun, interesting men that women like. They’re usually pretty non-sexual. Quality:
 Easy to associate with – doesn’t challenge her much
- Positive and upbeat
- Not thought of as “sexy” / not sexually aggressive
- Safe (isn’t going to hurt her)
- Helps her / takes care of things for her / invites her to events and partie


#### boyfriend
Women can picture themselves in a relationship
with. They’re fairly stable and attractive, and women feel pretty safe around them. Quality: 
Fun to spend time with
- Challenges women a little
- Positive and upbeat
- Fairly sexually attractive / aggressive
- Fairly safe
- Reasonably stable lifestyle / career and is local
- Helps her / takes care of things for her / invites her to events and parties

Comparing to friend, boyfriend challenges women a bit more and is more sexually attractive and aggressive. I’ve also included stability and locality – a lesser issue for friends.


#### husband
The guys that girls can find just about nothing wrong with. Perceive them to be stable, available, and safe. 
Can imagine themselves having a family with and spending a lifetime together, they are: 
- Fun to spend time with
- Challenges women a little
- Positive and upbeat
- Fairly sexually attractive / aggressive
- Safe (isn’t going to hurt her)
- Very stable lifestyle / career and is local
- Helps her / takes care of things for her / invites her to events and parties

difference with boyfriend is in degree – the husband just offers more value than the boyfriend – and also in stability – the husband is in a better position to be a good provider for his family.


#### lover
-> it's when the "small drama" come handy to keep a girl ? Like perpetually keep showing her she need to tame you ?? 

They provide value as follows:
- Fun to spend time with
- Challenges women a fair to a large amount
- Positive and upbeat
- Very sexually attractive /aggressive
- Mildly dangerous (he might hurt her)
- Unstable lifestyle / career (low-paying job, in a relationship already) or is not local / just visiting / on vacation / is someone she meets on her vacation
