you’re going to be rewarding or punishing a woman’s actions – and thus, her kind of investment.
=> **reward good behavior !!!!** 
- Instead of complain or highlighting negative; focus on positive, by encouraging it -> the negative will magically diseaper.

#### Reward 
main 3 ways to reward: 
- Giving her more attention: focusing your eye, open body language, face her with more of your body
- Complimenting or qualifying her on things you like: 
	- don't necesarly do it immediatly, sometime it's better to wait a couple of minute. 
		- *if she is being more attentive for example*
- Giving her physical affection or stimuli: 

> the best managers don’t just punish when employees make mistakes; they build up and reinforce when employees do a good job.

#### Punishing
punishing must never come off as reactive,
and must never come off as over-the-top.
-> rule of thumbs: You must never seem to
be emotionally affected by a woman’s negative behavior.

two primary way: 
- Withdrawing attention
	- get bored
	- Let your eyes drift away slightly and glaze over. Slowly lean back in your seat. Let your interest start fading out and pulling away.
		- be subtle
- Being dismissive:
	- if she says something I don't like, it's ok to be dismissive and change the topic.
	- “steamrolling” -> She is saying things that  are moving you and her in the wrong direction, so steamrolled them and moved you and her back onto something more productive.


Punishing is important for
- showing a woman you have limits
- keeping things on track
