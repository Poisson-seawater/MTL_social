when a man begins meeting women, one of the first things he realizes is that most guys are too nice. They’re pushovers; they supplicate; they do whatever women ask them to do. 
-> Law of less effort; 
-> beggar are not sexy

SO find the "golden rule" of challenge, some but not extrême. 
-> keep boundary


#### No Challenge vs. Unattainable
*Let’s say you walked into a nightclub and a woman threw herself at you. She walked up to you and just told you she’d do anything you wanted, and that she belonged to you. But you’d just met her and didn’t even know her. Some guys might take the opportunity to bring her home and have a fun night with her, if she was cute enough; others wouldn’t want to – but I guarantee that almost no one would have any interest in dating this girl.*
-> She’s saying with her actions that she isn’t really worthy of him.

Things to avoid that can make a man no challenge for a woman:
- Buying a woman drinks, food, flowers, or gifts when just meeting her for the first time, or too frequently in a relationship (w*hat has she done to earn these gifts?*).
- Qualifying himself; 
	- e.g., she asks him if he’s a good cook, and he says, “Oh yes, of course! I can cook this and that and the other thing, and I’m really good at… blah blah.” This is a case of the man working too hard to build commonalities and relatability.
- Offering more compliance than she is giving him back / putting in more work and effort than she is.


most important things to avoid that can make a man
seem unattainable:
- Being too mean / too big a jerk / overly critical, negative, or insulting.
- Failing to reward a woman’s efforts to provide value – or worse, punishing them – for instance, if she brings a man food or a drink and he says, “I don’t want that”.
- Failing to give her enough interest / attention.
- Failing to escalate quickly enough or when an escalation window is open

-> she do that to protect her ego and the fear of being reject. 



#### Turning Around Auto-Rejection
If a woman is auto-rejecting, then the men made a mistake in the seduction.Turning it around is quite often a lost cause – but not always.

The best way to deal with auto-rejection is just honesty and humility, and reassuring a girl that yes, you do like her. 


While taking a woman to the point of auto-rejection and bringing her back can be incredibly powerful for forging a high degree of attraction and a rock-solid bond, it should not be attempted by social beginners.
