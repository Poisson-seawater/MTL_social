> women want desirable men 
> -> lover value <=> she can him tame in long term (*without loosing his lover attribute*)


###### To be Prince Charming focused on these long-term value:
- Attention to her
- Money / resources available
- Money / resources spent on her
- Devotion and loyalty to her
- Reliability and dependability – he’ll be there when he says he will and when she needs him
- Cautious, with the ability to protect her and make her feel safe


###### Lover value
Lover value=> being sexually attractive and fulfilling women’s sexual fantasies. Lovers are **short-term focused** it's asset by: 
- He dates around or has lots of women and female friends in his life
- He is not needy and is comfortable with women (not desperate to mate, like men without women in their lives tend to be)
- He challenges women and is selective / picky about the women he dates
- He displays positive feelings and has constructive interactions with women (opposed to the many men with bitterness toward women, which communicates a history of rejection by the opposite sex)
- He’s busy – implying that he has other things he must attend to, and perhaps other women he must attend to
- He is passionate, adventurous, and spontaneous


##### misconceptions:
1. Women don’t actually want men who are short-term focused – women all only want relationships, and only end up with short-term focused men if those men trick them.
2. Women get hurt by men who become intimate with them without giving them long-term relationships.

###### Reality:  
> women desire desirable men.

Women do want men with lover value – in fact, women are more sexually attracted to these men than to the providers. Why? Men who are short-term lovers usually subconsciously communicate that they have good genetic (*fuck boy have more sex ->her son will propage her genetic more*).

what every woman, is a man who can satisfy both sides of the coin.
-> women tend to fantasize about a man with incredible lover value – a passionate, adventurous man all the other girls want – that only she is able to tame. (*see classic woman romance novel*).



#### Other Value
that not cleanly fit into either lover or provider categorie or  separate varieties of value completely outside the lover/provider spectrum: 
- Pre-Selection – a man is desired by other women
- Social Proof – he is sociable and draws people and friends to him and around him
- Protector – he has the ability and inclination to protect those around him
- Social Grace – he holds his own in social situations and gets what he wants
- Resourceful – he has exclusive knowledge and resources
- Witty – he’s able to make clever remarks without being goofy or over-the-top
- Fashionable – he dresses attractively
- Confident – he’s self-assured and knows he’ll get what he wants
- Successful – he’s staked his place in life and has achievements
- Comfortable – he’s relaxed and in control of the situation around him
- Effortless – he seems to get what he wants with a minimum amount of effort


#### How to behave - wrap up
no lie, instead be mysterious and evasif
-> [[Loi 32 - Toucher l’imaginaire]]

No need to impress, you need to marketing yourself right -> only show what is needed
