#### Relatability
more subtle part of attainability that’s easy to miss.
Relatability is a woman’s ability to relate to you and feel that the two of you share a common bond.

Relatability demand to find in one's "nich" kind of girl. It's about one's interest and life experience too. 


If you know you like a certain kind of girl, start doing what she does and going where she goes to learn how to better relate to her.

Relatability comes down to two things:
- Having a range of experiences to pull from.
- Being able to communicate those experiences


#### Relating
When in process of relating to women, two things to keep in mind:
1. Communicate that you’re on the same page and you both share the same experiences.
2. Avoid seeming like you’re trying to relate, or force a connection.

The best way to relate is to get girls to open up to you, then communicate that you relate.

###### Exemple 
Guy: How do you spend your time?

Girl: Well, I really like to scuba dive. I just was in Australia and went diving off the Great Barrier Reef.

Guy: How cool. Man, the Barrier Reef must’ve been amazing! My introduction to scuba was having to save my girlfriend from drowning in a pool a few years back when we both bumbled around with the gear on in a Caribbean vacation.

Girl: Wow, that’s horrible. So you go diving? Where have you gone diving at before?
