IF she see a hot guys well dress and to perfect. Then she won't try.

#### Verbal Attainability Technology
Verbal attainability tech consists of things like rewarding women for good behavior, screening them properly, and giving them genuine compliments.
- Rewarding Good Behavior: this reassures women that you are real and sincer. Other argument: leaders build up and approve of those around them.
- Screening: the reason that screening is so potent is that it reassures women that you don’t go for just any woman, and that you have standards. Why do women care? Because no one wants to feel like they’re getting the same treatment as everyone else and are replaceable.
- Genuine Compliments: “I like that you…” or “I like you…” are very good things to use. Very good. Reassure women that you like things about them, and that you approve of them.
	- related to rewarding, but doesn’t necessarily have to come as a response to an action by her
	- One note: if you’re complimenting on something she could potentially take as supplication (such as her looks), be absolutely sure to do it in a very nonchalant way.
- Stating the Obvious: most useful if a woman you’re with vocalizes doubt about where things are going with you or if you really like her. So, she might tell you that she feels like you’re not really all that into her. Your reply: “Hey, look. I’m sitting here with you, when I could be sitting anywhere else in the world with anyone else. But I’m not with anyone else; I’m with you. I like you. If I’m not really all that into you… well, that’s news for me!” And give her a smile so she knows you mean it. You might grab her and pull her close or throw an arm around her shoulders when you tell her this, too, or even swing her legs over your lap.
- Communicating pickiness: big part of attainability is helping a woman to feel that she’s special. You do this through communicating that you’re picky and helping her see that you like her despite your pickiness. This is what screening does, but you shouldn’t be afraid to tell women you’re picky outright if the situation calls for it.


#### Nonverbal Attainability Technology
Some nonverbal techniques:
- slow smile:  communicate that you’re thinking about what she’s saying, and help you cement a bond with her much faster
- touch: when you touch on high points and use protective touching (*e.g., putting your arm in front of her as she’s stepping out into the street in order to stop her from walking into traffic, or placing your hand on her lower back to guide her through a crowd*), it cements the bond quite strongly and demonstrates that you are looking out for her and are concerned for her
- Leaning in
- Pulling in
- Paying attention during the important stuff: not just leaning in, but fixing your eyes firmly on her and giving her rapt attention when she is talking about issues that are serious or have emotionally affected her.
	- It’s best to balance this by being a bit less attentive during less serious conversations
