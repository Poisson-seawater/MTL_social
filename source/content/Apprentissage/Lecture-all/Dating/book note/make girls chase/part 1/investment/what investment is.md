#### Investment intro
A woman's current level of investment is how she decides what she is, or isn't, willing to do with that new man she's just met.

Women value, and chase after, the men they are highly invested in.
-> as the reward of the investement feel WAY bigger !!!
-> the woman you work hard to get are the one you appreciate the most
=> How greatly a woman values something is directly linked to how invested in it she is. Which means, if a woman invests a great deal in you, she will value you very highly, desire you more, and even begin to pursue you.

> Women want men who can make them invest. 
> *they want the free diner and all free stuff, but the guys that offer those are not the one she date !!*


### What Investment is

Investment is any time or effort spent on you by a woman, it is: 
- [[Compliance]]: does something you ask or demand
- [[Rumination]]: time and effort she spends thinking about you
- Time spend togheter
- [[Auto investment]]: things she does for you without promptings.


> If value is the key that opens the door to a woman's heart, investment is the arm that swings that door open and the legs that carry you through it.

==reward investment from women !!== Failing to reward her can damage your attainability and make you seem too hard to get. Approve after her investment otherwise she will think she is unable to please you.
