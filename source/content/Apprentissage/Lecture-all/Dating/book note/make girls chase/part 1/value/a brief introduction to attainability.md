Showing your value is half the battle. The other half is, managing her ability to feel as if she can get you – attain you. 

three ways attainability can go:
- A woman feels it’s too easy to attain you and you’re easy to get.
- She feels challenged to attain you, but feels she ultimately has a reasonable chance to get you.
- She feels it’s too hard to attain you and she can’t get you

If your attainability is too high, women will be overly nice. If your attainability is too low, women will be bitter, rude, and short.


#### Too Easy
If a woman feels a man is too easy, she will think little of him and his value (if he’s so valuable, why is he so easy to get?).


#### Too Hard
If too much value, woman will dismiss him in a very short, bitter, resentful way, seeking to take revenge and hurt his feelings.


#### Just Right
=> Goldilocks and the 3 bear.

Two reasons why it's hard to be Just Right:
- Because you’re constantly improving yourself, adapting, and growing higher in value – thus, by default, you become increasingly harder to get
- Every girl you meet is different with different experiences with men and different levels of self-esteem. You might meet two different girls who look exactly the same, but one of them assumes automatically that you’re too easy for her and the other assumes you’re out of her league

See being attainable as a game !!


Social intuition will tell you when a girl is feeling unchallenged (she thinks you’re too easy) or overwhelmed (she thinks you’re too much for her). As soon as you pick up on that, you’ll begin adjusting accordingly.


[[four essentials of managing attainability]]:
- screening her
- accepting her value offerings
- rewarding her
- adressing her challenge


##### Her 3 questions
When a woman see you, she wonder on those 3  questions:
1. **Is this for real?**
	1. share her energy level and consistency
		1. vs insencere
	2. behave as building intrigue, attraction, and a connection that might lead to intimacy later.
2. **Can a girl like me get a guy like him**?
	1. she is just as low esteem as the other people
		1. she too have fear of rejection
	2. it's why have story of having seen girl like her, so you appear attainable.
3. **Does he respect me as a friend**?
	1. she needs to understand that you view her as a fellow human being worthy of your respect.
