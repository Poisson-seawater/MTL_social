#### opener basic
###### rules 
1. Avoid full frontal opening.
	1. open somewhat across your body or over your shoulder, only turning to face her more fully as she earns your attention
2. Avoid opening from the back.
	1. Just as opening from the front can seem overly pushy or forward
3. Pre-open her <=> get her to look at you before you look at her.
	1. [[the Game general|peacocking]]
	2. in a way that it feel like you are responding to her checking you out.
		1. VS look at them first, they feel like the objects of desire, and as if they are being stared
	3. **way of pre-opening a girl**
		1. is to position yourself next to her, then lightly tap her on the arm/touch her with the backside of your hand, 
			1. only fully turning your head to face her and locking eyes with her once her eyes are locked on yours.
5. **Drop the apologies: bad 1st impression as a rule of tumbs**
6. Lock in as soon as possible 
	1. <-> getting into the position of being comfortable and “at home” with a girl or a group.
	2. *If two people are speaking, and one is sitting on a stool while the other stands, the one who is seated is locked in.*

#### genuine interest
also called “direct” – is the most powerful, effective style of opener you can use.

**genuine interest** is state outright that you’re talking to her because there’s something about her you like.

#### ground rule:
 - **Ground your opener**. such as “I saw you walking here, and I just had to come tell you that…” or, “You know, I saw you sitting here, and I had to come and say that…”
- **Compliment her on something genuinely**: like hair, style ...
- **Use interesting words**, -> [[__ commonplace Book]]
- **Follow up your opener with an introduction**: After giving a girl a great compliment, she may not know what to say. Rather than put her in the position of awkwardly fishing for words, or blurting out a clumsy “thank you,” offer your name instead.
- **the object of your opener is to make her feel special**


#### Investment
open with something that gets the girl to [[investment|invest]] in the conversation.

*Exemple: Motion for her to give you her hand, then inspect a ring or bracelet or other piece of jewelry she has on, while still holding her hand. Then give her a quizzical look, as if asking her to explain it. If she doesn’t offer to on her own, ask her what it means.*

#### situation revelant
use the environment for opener and investment

the easiest form of opener for social beginners – it’s low pressure and less intimidating to use than other openers.

relevant openers are a double-edged sword: 
- they have a higher opening percentage than genuine interest, simply because they’re conversational opening pieces without any explicit romantic overtures. 
- However, they also have a lower closing percentage than genuine interest.

=> avoid complaining when delivering a situationally relevant opener.


#### playfull
Playful openers are things like sidling up next to a woman and bumping your hip into hers, or catching a woman’s eye and making a funny face at her or sticking your tongue out at her, or mimicking her body language back at her.

Reaction to expect: 
- l laugh and begin engaging you right away after you deliver playful openers –
	- they’ll usually start by asking you something, or making a witty or sarcastic mark back to you in keeping with the spirit of the interaction you’ve started. 
- Other times, they’ll smile but still wait for you to engage them
