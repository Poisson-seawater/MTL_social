When you’ve just met a girl, there’s often a brief introductory period of back-and-forth, banter, or repartee. This is the finding-out phase.


Repartee is the fun, engaging aspect of an interaction where you establish a little playful back-and-forth. Compose of:
- [[being witty]]
- [[intrigue]]
- [[push pull]]
- [[chase framing]]
- Teasing: To Tease or Not to Tease

Typically, repartee lasts anywhere from a couple witty remarks to a few minutes.
IF repartee extends out past five minutes, it’s gone on too long. Either the girl is only interested in bantering; you are only interested in bantering; or neither one of you has figured out how to move things forward.
