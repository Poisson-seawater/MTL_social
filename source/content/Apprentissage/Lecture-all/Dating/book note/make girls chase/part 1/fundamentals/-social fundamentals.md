Socializing:
- Social power
- Try Hard VS Accomplished
- Conversing

#### Social power
The highest the social power, the more desirable you get.

-> HOW [[Loi 14 -  Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy]]


###### Definition
Social Power is the individual who gets the greatest amount of **attention** with the least amount of **effort**.
-> comes off as attractive and desired.

Someone who neither expends **effort** nor receives **attention** can be either invisible, or can sometimes seem mysterious and intriguing (since most people in social situations are competing for attention).

*on the effort /attention axis, the other possibility are Creep or Attention Seeker.*

Social Power is:
- Expending little effort
- Getting attention
- Being need-free
- Giving social value

##### Law of Least Effort
for:
- dominance
- conversation
- need
- giving

###### dominance
the man exerting the least amount of effort wins (*the Social Power*). 
-> so speak least with [[_ Éloquence - Voix|Éloquence]]

Dominance displays exemple: 
- one man tries to “tool” another with:
	- “Hey bro, nice haircut. I used to have the same cut in first grade.”
- The Dominance answer is: 
	- merely smiles in a bemuse ways then return to whatever I was doing. 
	- **WHY:** the individual making the greater effort of verbal footwork is the person with lesser social power.

###### conversation
A consequence of the **Dominance**;
For text and online: sending shorter messages with less attempts to build a connection-> creat more social power.

###### need
The more someone seems to need something from another person or group –*whether it’s approval, acceptance, or interest*– the lesser his social
power is. 
The more independent and secure you appear, the greater your social power rise.

###### giving
The more giving of social value –*like genuine
compliments, being inclusive, helping others to feel connected to him ...* – the greatest amount of social power you get.


#### Try Hard VS Accomplished
When starting, you will appear as try hard; be aware. 

Some contrast between an accomplish social strategist and a beginner

| **Action** | **Social Beginner (More Effort)** | **Social Strategist (Less Effort)** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Other person is hard to hear** | Leans in (more effort) | Stands tall or leans back while using his face to show he doesn’t hear (less effort) |
| **Other person attempts joke or insult at his expense** | Tries to respond / defend himself / launch a comeback (more effort) | Smiles in a bored way, ignores the remark, or shrugs and turns his attention elsewhere (less effort) |
| **Other person asks for compliance (a drink, for him to move, etc.)** | Gives a reason why he can’t, or just complies (more effort) | Deflects the request, such as by saying, “Maybe later” (less effort) |
| **In conversation** | Uses long and verbose stories and statements (more effort) | Speaks concisely and to the point (less effort) |
| **In movement / positioning** | Moves around a lot, fidgets, remains in uncomfortable positions (more effort) | Relaxes, gets himself into a more comfortable position than everyone else (less effort) |
| **Eye contact** | Checks others and environment constantly, hoping for eye contact and seeking a reaction (more effort) | Often is lost in his own world, or otherwise is focused intently upon the person he’s speaking with and ignoring all else (less effort) |
| **Attention** | Tries to get others’ attention (more effort) | Is good at making others try to get his attention (less effort) |





#### Conversing
Is the art of steering a conversation toward interesting, positive, constructive topics.


> RULE: the more someone tells you about herself, the more connected to you she feels.
> - cause she will feel you, by listening, know her





###### compelling topics for woman:
- Emotions
- Drama and Fighting
- Relationships
- Danger
- Excitement
- Predictions, Destiny, and Coincidences
- Adventure and the Exotic

Listener HAVE to relate to everything you’re
telling -> [[parler pour Inspirer]]

##### three big conversation techniques:
- Thread Cuttin
- Thread Amplifying
- Thread Looping.

###### Thread Cutting
most people don’t want to talk about boring things, but sometimes they want to keep the conversation going and can’t come up with anything interesting.

SO: 
- creat the new thread around a word from her previous sentence,
- AND relating to the overall sentiment she expressed earlier.

Exemple:
- Today I was at the office, but the damn printer wouldn’t work and my boss got  on my case for not handing in my reports on time,” you can say:
	- relate to your bad feeling about your boss, then ask relate and more question about Work in general. 


###### Thread Amplifying
To reinforce her investissement about an interesting topics
- “No way. Tell me more,” or, “Go on,” or, “How’d that happen?” or, “How’d that make you feel?”
- OR share a related experience yourself, to encourage her to stay on this topic with you.


###### Thread Looping.
retain multiple open conversational threads by opening another thread mid-thread.
- *talk about restaurant, then the Italian you eat, the calamari steak for apetizer and ask her if she had eat calamari.*


#### Social momentum
it's the warmup for socializing. 
Rule:
1. the first 3 to 5 interaction are warm-up
2. carefull of de-warmup -> just like in sport
3. if talk for too long to one person, you will lose that momentum and have to warm up again

Instead of alcool for socializing, use social momentum !!
