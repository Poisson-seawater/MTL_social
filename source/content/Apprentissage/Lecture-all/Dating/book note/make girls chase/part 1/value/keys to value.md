four main points:
- There’s no such thing as actual value – only the value that others have been shown counts.
- Value that is unstated and shown implicitly is superior to value that is only stated explicitly in words.
- Women must be able to access your value to feel like they can get you.
- It’s important to not be too hard to get, nor too easy to get – aim for balance.

When assessing your progress with value, two keys to value to consider:
1. Am I showing value, and is it mostly implied – or am I stating too much explicitly?
2. Am I attainable – not too easy to get, but not too hard?
