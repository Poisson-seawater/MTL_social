Also called unstated and stated value.

Any time and every time you can use ==Implicit Value== in place of Explicit Value. 

**Explicit Value** (*stated value*) should be used sparingly. I’ve always liked to say, “If you have to say it, it isn’t true,” 

**Implicit Value** (*unstated value*) to us frequently and readily. This is the kind of value that people really use to make value judgments about other.

#### Explicit Value
It's "I drive a Bentley and pull down six figures,"
-> feel like **bragging** and showboating

A man using Explicit Value positions himself as someone seeking to impress another – and thus as someone chasing, rather than being chased
-> Law of last effort

OR out of her league. -> Attainability

##### [[intrigue|Baiting]]
Let clues about you so she can ask about it !!


#### Implicit Value
Implicit means that your value is implied. 
Someone picks up on clues to your value that you do not state directly. <-> comme Marshal quand sa job d'avocat ce passe mal !!!

-> [[Story Telling - new people]]

It's a girl notice that you: 
Are talking to three other pretty girls nearby, and they all seem to be enjoying themselves or vying for your attention
- Are well-liked and sociable, with other people talking with you
- Are walking confidently and have great posture
- Make confident eye contact
- Have a great fashion sense
- Have a tan in the wintertime – maybe you have been traveling
- Are wearing some interesting item – maybe there’s a story behind it
- Are smiling and happy – things must be going your way

Additional ways to use implicit value:
- You mention things in passing in telling a story (covered shortly)
- You drop subtle hints and baits, but avoid answering completely when probed
