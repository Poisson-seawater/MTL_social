Use incidental touch often, and use it generously. You should be continuously touching the women you’re getting to know. 

When you meet a girl, take her hand in yours and draw her in for a kiss on both cheeks, asthey do in Europe; let your hand linger in hers a little when you lower it afterward. This is a good indicator very early on of her interest level; many women will continue holding onto your hand even as you lower it. You can easily end up in the situation where you never let go of the girl’s hand, and she never lets go of yours, and you just hold hands and talk. When you find yourself here, give her a gentle yank after a few minutes and pull her into you. When women dig you like this early on, you can pull their bodies against yours and quickly transition incidental touch to romantic touch with a sexual nuance.

Another powerful incidental touch is placing your hand on her side near her waist, and leaving it there while you talk; or, if she’s closer, placing your hand on the small of her back.

With any of these three – holding her hand; hand on her waist; hand on her back – you can move her around physically. Often you want to draw her quickly into a conversation – just pull her closer to you. You don’t need to explain this or say anything as you do it – just do it. If she asks why you brought her closer (something only a few women ask), you can tell her that you wanted to get a better look at her, or if you’re in a crowded, high-traffic area you might tell her you’re bringing her closer to hear her a little better.

Incidental touch also includes any part of your body touching hers, like your arm touching her arm while standing together and waiting for something, your leg touching her leg while sitting next to each other, or her breast against your chest if you draw her in close to you and the two of you are having a good conversation.

> rely on your instincts more, and trust that if it feels good for you, generally it feels good for her too.

incidental touch is important cause it gets
women accustomed to being touched by you + closes the tension gap. 
The brain is wired to respond to touch as a sign of attraction.

To be aware regarding incidental touch:
- Using the palm of your hand to touch a girl is warm and receptive, while using the back of your hand is cold and distant. As a seducer, you will typically be using the palm of your hand, except perhaps when first meeting a new woman and initially getting her attention.
- Avoid the “tap” at all costs. Social beginners will sometimes try to get their incidental touch in by “tapping” women – briefly alighting their hands or fingers on some part of a woman’s body, then quickly pulling them away. This communicates a lack of confidence that one’s touch will be well-received – it’s almost better not to touch at all.  When touching, always aim to let your hand linger for two to three seconds, at least – and sometimes longer.
- Maintain eye contact while touching. Men who are new to touching will often look where they are going to touch / where they are touching, to make sure they hit the right spot. This looks very strange and calculated to women who are engaged in a conversation with them, though, and makes the touch feel quite awkward. Touch should be natural andeffortless – a woman wants to feel like the man she’s speaking with doesn’t have to think about it, and that it just happens. Avoid staring at your hand as you touch a woman – keep your eyes on hers.
- You should begin practicing such contact touching a woman’s upper arm with your open palm or cupping her elbow. Do these perhaps two to three times each on high points. The next parts of her body you should generally touch are her stomach, waist, and outer / upper thighs (when seated).
