Compliance is how you get women doing things for you proactively, rather than waiting for them to take the initiative.

Women want men to make them give compliance – they find it exciting and refreshing.
Most women need you to take the lead in getting them to invest – and they are waiting for you to
do so.

=> great way to make her [invest] in you
 
 
###### Exemple:
Hold my seat for a moment, I'll be right back,” she's complying with you (even if all she does is sit there and wait!).
-> do this !!!


##### Compliance request
exemple; 
-  “Can you hand me a napkin?”
-  “Shall we meet at 4 o'clock?”
-  “May I have this dance?”


Compliance requests are best used in the following situations:
-  When you're a beginner and not sure what kind of compliance to use.
-  When you're with a woman who is more dominant / independent.
-  When you're with a woman who is resisting your compliance demands.


##### Compliance demands
Compliance demands are when you give an order for compliance – rather than asking for it.

exemple
- “Hand me a napkin, sweetheart.”
- “Let's meet at 4 o'clock.”
- “Let's dance.”

Note on compliance demands: tonality is key.

##### Taken compliance
IF fundamentals down extremely well, you can begin an interaction with taken compliance, and skip the lower and intermediate levels of compliance requests and demands.

examples of taken compliance:
- Taking a girl's hand and telling her, “Come,” and leading her somewhere.
- Physically moving a girl to the side so that you can stand next to her or pulling her closer to sit more closely next to you.
- Kissing her and being more intimate with her.
