Be wary of using self-deprecation around very young women, or other kinds of women who are not very socially adept, but trust thatall other women will understand it, and appreciate it.


Way of responding to a challenge by joking that one is lower value. -> show confidence and assurance. 
Exemple: 
Girl: I only date men with good professions.
Guy: Good thing I just got promoted to head taco maker.

=> give dismissal of her attempt to screen you + show you as above her screen.
