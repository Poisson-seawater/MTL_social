A quick pull is when you pull a woman (or women) you’ve just met to go somewhere with you. Any venue where people are moving around on their way somewhere, or normally wouldn’t stay very long, is conducive to quick pulls.
=> past nightclub is perfect for quick pull if she is in the mood for intimacy (*she already failed the whole night*)

###### past night club
Typically, on the street, you will want to propose a girl (or girls) joins you for an after party. 
IF she asks where the people are when you get home THEN, simply tell her your friend or roommate was out at a different place, and he has some people with him who might come to your place, or they might go somewhere else.
AFTER: just move on the conversation.

With a quick pull, this can be a bit of a crapshoot; sometimes the girl assumes that’s what you’re going back for, sometimes not.
