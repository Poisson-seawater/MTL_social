responding to challenges with challenges.
Make you more likely to be called an “asshole” or a “smartass” than called a “nice guy” or a “sweetheart".

IF good repartee THEN it show you are confident BUT damages your attainability (As you keep throwing challenges back at her, you seem increasingly hard to get).

Challenging looking like this:
Girl: I only date men with good professions.
Guy: You mean like those guys who shine your shoes for a dollar?
