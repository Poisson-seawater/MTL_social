The pull is just another part of the play, so you got to keep with all the technique show before. 

Some natural pulls: 
I’m hungry. Let’s go grab some food.”
- “Let’s head next door, it’s a little loud and crazy in here.”
- “Let’s go grab a nightcap – I know a place nearby with great music and really cheap drinks.”
	- *your place, of course* 
	- Need to let the social lie so she can keep her "denial" and preserve her face when telling her friend.

It’s the woman’s role in a seduction to follow the man’s lead and view everything as “just having happened.” It’s the man’s role to structure everything out in a seduction and make those things happen.
-> don't explain or try to shift the burden of making things happen. Just make it happen smootly. 

NOTE: she may say she have a husband or a boyfriend -> it's a social lie to preserve her face !! => She wants to be able to say it just happened, despite her best efforts.
SO this is why no explaination.

Even though you both know what’s likely going to happen, you must play the game of pretending that everything is completely innocent. You can use chase frames, and tease her a little, but you should avoid making it overt!!!

Many woman will add weak resistance -> got to play the game and be persistant.

###### Exception to "my place"
IF wall of resistance for going somewhere like another nightclub, restaurant etc ...
JUST propose explicitly your place. 
WHY: she may be thinking : “Great, now we have to go get food, and do more talking, and I’m not really hungry in the first place, and he might even just say ‘Okay, good night’ after we eat… I don’t want to do all that.” -> too much work for too much uncertainty.
