She is chacing you: how and when to close?

###### Terminology:
[[pulling]]: when you make her accompany you elsewhere (her/your home, eating spot...).
- WHEN: gut feeling + have moved her a little, escalated her level of investment and built a connection with her
- HOW: just invite her home. => have the right mindset
	- Women can sense neediness and uncertainty, and it unnerves them.
	- [[Quick Pulls]]

[[Standard pull]]
- natural pull: "I'm hungry, let's take some fresh air" .... 
- Men role is to make it happen smooth (*delivery*) as “just having happened.” -> so structure and plan. 
	- *no need for burden of proof* -> we are on TikTok here, documentary comes after
	- EXCEPTION: IF wall of resistance for going somewhere like another nightclub, restaurant etc ...
	- THEN propose explicitly your place. 
- Many woman will add weak resistance -> got to play the game and be persistant.
	- it's for her to preserve face and be able to say it just happened, despite her best efforts
	- SO must play the game of pretending that everything is completely innocent. You can use chase frames, and tease her a little, but you should avoid making it overt!!!



[[hitting escalation windows properly]] opportunity for you to move things forward with a girl – usually physically. Escalation windows can be tricky, because they usually don’t stay open long and once they’ve closed, it can be nearly impossible to get things moving forward again

Escalation windows are: 
- telling her to sit near you
- invite her to go somewhere with less people
- increasing intimacy -> kiss her to sex

IF you’ve missed a window, THEN focus mostly on attainability when attempting to restore attraction. Go easy on chase frames.



[[logistics]] acces to moving to private locations for intimacy,
Getting intimate in an unusual locale can often be easier, because most women lack prior experiences in these – and thus, feel less pressure and resistance to becoming intimate in such places + excitation of something new.
- dark alley
- bathroom 

 [[Transition Points]] keep 
- things light and low-pressure during these critical moments of a pull.
- the conversation flowing so it feels completely natural for you to stick together, and keep things moving forward.


[[getting intimate]]: don't wait -> creat presure, start within 5 to 10min of arriving home. 
-> unless she need some time to get confortable.
Skip the bra and shut up + add cover on both of you -> make it easier
