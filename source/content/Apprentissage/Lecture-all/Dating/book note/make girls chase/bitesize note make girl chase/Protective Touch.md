Nonverbal means of communicating to make her feel safe and comfortable.

You can exaggerate a little; she probably isn’t actually about to step out into the path of an oncoming vehicle, but you can place your arm in front of her and hold her back regardless.

###### Example: 
- Hand on her back while moving through a crowd. This assures her that you want to keep her close and that you don’t lose her.
- Holding her hand while moving through a crowd. Same as the first, although a little easier to do and not quite as powerful.
- Placing your arm in front of her body to prevent her crossing the street when there is traffic. A good habit to get into the habit of doing, as it is easy for people to get distracted in conversation (especially a romantic, flirtatious conversation), and just good form in general – stop her a few feet back from the street, and she will get a small degree of the “my hero” feeling women get toward men they feel safe around.
- Pulling her back when there is a fight or disruption nearby, or placing your hand on her shoulder. Even if it’s on the other side of the room, it’s a nice gesture by you that shows you have concern for her, and will make her feel safer and more comfortable with you.
