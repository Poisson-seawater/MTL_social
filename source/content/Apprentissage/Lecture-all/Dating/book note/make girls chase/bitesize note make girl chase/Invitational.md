Take the opportunity of a woman challenging you to invite her to do something with you.
Powerfull as you are planting an idea in her mind. 
Usually after some of the initial getting-to-know-you stuff is out of the way.

###### Exemple
*Girl: Are you any good as a cook?*
*Guy: Maybe Iâ€™ll have you come over some time to make a meal*
*and let you be the judge.*
-> **Be only half joking.** 

###### Goal : 
she has the chance to picture the two of you alone and consider you in a more intimate way.

Is very good for setting the right mood and moving things along quickly.
