four big ways to generating rumination:
1. Cause her to fall in love with you.
2. Give her a task to do for you in her free time.
3. Give her something to try and figure out about you.
4. Give her a reason to be angry at and resent you.

##### Tasking her
When you give a woman a task to do in her free time, she's going to be thinking about you while she plans and enacts the task. 

Great way to have her investing in you withou you needing to even be present.


##### Intriguing her
Getting a woman pondering about you and what you might do / feel is one of the top ways to elicit rumination. Example 
- “Does he like me?”
- “How much does he like me?”
- “Is he going to suggest we do [fill in] thing together?”
- “Does he have a girlfriend?”
- “Is he going to make a move when I see him / go here with him?”

> for those kind of question, you MUST create intrigue, so IF you answer one of them, create a new question on suspend


##### Angering her
kind of "dark psychology" here !!

1. she thought a lot about you -> high investment
2. When a woman gets angry, and you fix things. She realizes that you’re one of those rare men who is strong enough to stick it out through bad situations, fix those issues, and make her feel good again.
	1. make her feel good, without resorting to weak, unmasculine behavior like supplicating, apologizing, or buying presents.
	2. Groveling and supplicating will temporarily alleviate a woman’s anger, at the cost of her losing attraction for the man who supplicates. -> [law of least effort]

How to make up with her:
- Spending time with her and sharing enough experiences to make new, good memories
- Addressing your action, her emotion, and “making up”.

###### Addressing your action
exemple: tu abordes une fille, répond a ton cell d'un coup. Puis tu dis a la fille "Hold a minute". She will leave. Finish the call, go back to her. Say your behavior was rude, so you treat her to ice cream.

Why it work ?
1. You upset her, which showed her (subconsciously) that she values you and wants your attention – this leads her to value you and your attention more.
2. You recognized how you hurt her – something most people are incapable of doing. This shows her that you understand and empathize with her, and makes her feel like you “get” her very well.
3. You offer to make it up to her, which shows her that you care and want there to be good feelings between the two of you.
