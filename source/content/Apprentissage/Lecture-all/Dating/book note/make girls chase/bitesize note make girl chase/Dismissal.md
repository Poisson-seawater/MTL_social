To use judiciously. You can be dismissive of
flighty / off-hand remarks women make, but you absolutely do not want to be dismissive of actual concerns (show low attainability).

With dismissal, you’re going to shrug off a woman’s comment, and move on in the conversation. Looks like this:
Girl: I only date men with good professions.
Guy: Really? Oh, cool [bored tone]. So do you travel at all?

To use best against ridiculous challenge.
