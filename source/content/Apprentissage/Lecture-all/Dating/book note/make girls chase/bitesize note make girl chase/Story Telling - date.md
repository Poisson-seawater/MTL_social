It’s a way of communicating – both explicitly and implicitly – your value, and sharing your interests and adventures with others. When you’re just starting out as a storyteller, focus on making your storie  fairly short. 
CAUSE: Long stories occur further in a conversation. -> when she is invest in you !!


basics of storytelling:
- lenght: short vs long
	- long issues: come as trying to force a connection
- involvement:
	- Involve women in your stories: ask them questions, throw in pauses for them to interject with their own stories, and insert rhetorical questions (“How crazy is that?”).
	- keep her engage, active and maintain her level of investement & effort
- Construction:
	- Introduction -> Arc -> Climax -> Conclusion.
- Front-Loading Emotion
	- Use statements at the outset of a story to get a women more involved in your story and more excited to listen through the climax.
	- Try including statements like, “Have you ever had a day when nothing went according to plan?” or, “Have you ever had a really weird coincidence that you thought couldn’t possibly be by chance?”


For short stories, you should generally keep yourself armed with at least one cool experience that’s happened to you in the last week. -> take anything, just make sure you tell it in an interesting way. 

Keep it to one or two longer stories that discuss sex and/or dating per interaction, maximum – more than that and you risk overloading the girl with too many thoughts of you with other women, and come off as either trying to impress or unattainable.

For both, avoid inventing, but you can (depend if she come as Wife material). 



###### Some notes on pacing:
- The introduction sets the tone – start off with a hint of what’s to come to get the listener interested enough that she’ll want to hear the rest of your tale.
- Emotion and suspense should build through the arc portion of the story.
- The climax needs to fit the arc – if you build a lot of emotion in the arc but have a weak climax, it feels very unsatisfying to the listener. Have a fitting climax.
- The conclusion needs to quickly follow the climax and tie the story together with the introduction.
	- If you take too long to reach the conclusion after the climax, it feels like you’re dragging the story out. 
	- If you fail to wrap the story up, it can seem slightly irrelevant, or the listener might wonder why you launched into that particular story / what relevance it had to the original topic.
