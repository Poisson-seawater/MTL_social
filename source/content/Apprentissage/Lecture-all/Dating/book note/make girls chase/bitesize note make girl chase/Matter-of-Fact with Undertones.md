takes a greater degree of confidence andmastery of facial expressions and voice tones than other types of responses -> Need insane Non Verbal skills.


It's like what Harrison Ford does in Indiana Jones when a woman is challenging him. He leans in very close, getting his face close to hers, in an almost intimidating way, but
with a slight, sly smile, and slightly droopy eyelids, and replies in alow voice that drips of sexuality in a very matter-of-fact way. His words are plain, and their very plainness turns the emphasis on his presentation, which is dripping with strength and sensuality.


Girl: I only date men with good professions.
Guy: My profession is very good. [doing the Harison Ford think]

Done correctly, the woman should almost interpret the words to have some kind of sexual meaning themselves. For instance, in the example above, the woman might get the idea pop into her head that maybe the man is going to tell her his profession is pleasing women. She might even ask him what he does, hoping he’ll respond playfully with something like that and build up the sexual intrigue.

To couple this style of response with invitational-style wording OR qualifying-esque words in the verbal portion of this reply.
