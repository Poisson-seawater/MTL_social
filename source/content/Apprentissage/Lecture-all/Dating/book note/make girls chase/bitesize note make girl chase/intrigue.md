> The more a woman thinks about you, the harder for you she falls

- [ ] d'autre fiche a lié ici !!

It’s the “silent” part of the clichéd female fantasy man of the “strong, silent type.”


| **Action** | **Social Beginner’s Response** | **Social Strategist’s Response** |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Girl asks question | Answers question satisfactorily | Maneuvers around question (as politicians do), asks a question back, or deflects the question |
| On a topic | Tells everything he has to tell or gives a full back story with nothing left to the imagination | Tells a story that mentions some things in passing and leaves other things hinted at but not fleshed out |
| On relationships | Makes his relationship status crystal clear | Is vague and noncommittal about relationship status – frequent use of the word “friend” and “girlfriend” in somewhat ambiguous ways |
