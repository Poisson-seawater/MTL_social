**investment** as the level of commitment 
-> initiated by your new female acquaintance as well.

RECAP:
- [[what investment is]]
	- investment is the HOW a woman perceive you and WHAT she will do with that nice stranger (you) 
		- the more she invest <=> the more she is interest in you
	- Women value, and chase after, the men they are highly invested in.
		- -> as the reward of the investement feel WAY bigger !!!
- [[-types of investment]]	
	- [[Compliance]]: does something you ask or demand, not necessarly use word
	- [[Rumination]]: time and effort she spends thinking about you
	- Time spend togheter
	- [[Auto investment]]: things she does for you without promptings.
- [[rewarding and punishing]]
	- always reward positive, never complain
	- reward by:
		- more attention
		- Complimenting or qualifying her on
			- her body
			- thing you like about her personnality (*wait a couple of minute for this one*)
		- Giving her physical affection or stimuli: 
	- punishing
		- withdraw attention
		- change topic
		- Punishing is important for
			- showing a woman you have limits
			- keeping things on track
- [[screening]]
	- to 
		- ger her to invest
		- show you have standard
	- it's about delivery your standard properly
	- patern: screen -> listen to her answer -> reward
	- [[How to screen]] -> Self-Description
- [[compliance stacking]]
