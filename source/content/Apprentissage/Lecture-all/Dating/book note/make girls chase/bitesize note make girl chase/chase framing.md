funny thing about a lot in socializing – it isn’t necessarily what people think they’re doing that matters most. It’s what you lead people to think they’re doing.


Frame is the term for the context used in understanding a thought, concept, or idea –
“women don’t like sex that much” is a frame, just like “women love sex as much as or more than men” is a different, opposing frame.

Using frame mean implying that the woman iss chasing after you. The key is that they need to accept this framing from you. It’s important that you make it come across as either 
- genuine (implying that she genuinely is pursuing you) or
- witty (teasing her about chasing after you).
- WHY: Girl will think well, if I’m chasing after him, it must be because I really like him and he’s a high quality guy
- IF she "Hey" or something
	- THEN move quickly to another subject


exemple of framing:
Girl: I really like your eyes.
Guy: Thank you. I hope you’re not just saying that to get in my pants… [smile and wink]
