- [[chasing at the outset]]
	- pre-open
		- touch to make her start the eye contact
	- relaxed body language and locking in
		- slightly bored tone of voice => so she have to impress you
	- Approach IF she position herself near you and facing directly toward you
- [[chasing in the middle]] of the conversation
	- start using chase [[frames]] + subtle nonverbal to imply she is chasing you
	- maintain a balance where women are putting in perhaps 10 or 20% more effort than you are
	- [[To give her encouragement]] Rewarding
		- Don't reward interest tho !!!
		- Being charming, sexy, and seductive;  warm or flirtatious, making you her feel good as you pursue, and let her though she is getting somewhere.
		- convers deeper
		- lead her
		- Escalating with her physically. in
			1. an increasingly intimate manner 
			2. and plain touching her more (*more physical contact & constant contact*) 
- [[chasing toward the end]]
	- Do the physical escalation, but use chase frames verbally to position her as the pursuer
- [[in-person vs. distance chasing]]
	- build a positive, rewarding experience for a woman while simultaneously using subtle verbal chase frames
- [[boyfriend dilemma]]
	- Chase framing facilitate to remove you from the “friends” category, 
		- and escalating intimacy and investment will do the rest. 
	- BUT, still the boyfriend dilemma: 
		- The more you improve, the more you become boyfriend material HENCE she want a secure commitment
- [[providing good feelings judiciously]]
	- make  her feel genuinely good
		- instead of making her feel used, insecure, intimidated, or resented.
	- BUT don't provide good feelings prior to intimacy.
