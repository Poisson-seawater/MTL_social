1. Flirting with her: Being charming, sexy, and seductive. 
	1. Using innuendoes, suggestion, and chase frames that hint at or imply the two of you getting together. 
		1. A lot of this is conveyed in voice tone and nonverbal communication.  
	2. -> check Ryan Reynolds in Van Wilder, and any James Bond movie with Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan.
3. Going into deep rapport with her: 
	1. Get a woman to open up with you. She will tell you intimate details about her past, her childhood, her dreams, and her relationships
		1. -> The better she feels you know her, the more comfortable she feels with you.
	2. She justifies you being attracted to her because you know her so well now; she knows you see her for her, and are not interested in just any girl who comes along.
5. Leading her. 
	1. Women respond to leading as a sign of interest. 
		1. Women take men asking them to move around to mean that the man is seeking to progress things forward with them.
	2. Having women move around with you and do things with you will make them feel closer to you and rewarded.
7. Escalating with her physically.
	1. => to communicate your attention interested in her
	2. Touching her in
		1. an increasingly intimate manner 
		2. and just plain touching her more (*more physical contact, more constant contact*)
