- **Stroking**. Caressing your hands up and down a woman’s body – whether her arms, her legs, her sides, her back, her face, her hair, or whatever else – are great to do in private, but best avoided in public.
- **Body kissing.** Rather than kissing her lips, focus on her neck, jaw, earlobes, shoulders, chest, breasts, nipples, arms, hands, stomach, thighs, labia, and other parts of her body. This is extremely erotic to women – much more so than kissing on the lips.
- **rubbing and fingering her genitals**
