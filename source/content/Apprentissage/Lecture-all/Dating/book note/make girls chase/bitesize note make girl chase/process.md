Basic one: 
Go out -> build social momentum by meeting new people and new woman -> seek to move women quickly -> continue meeting new women until you meet one you like who likes you too and will move with you -> move her quickly, get to know her -> take her home quickly -> escalate quickly to intimacy.


Keep process simple, but here are more detail on each steps.
