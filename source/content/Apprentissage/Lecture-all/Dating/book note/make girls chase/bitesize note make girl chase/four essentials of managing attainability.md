1. Screening her:
	1. it's probing for things you like. Asking things like, “Do you cook?” and, “Are you artistic?” are screens. 
	2. She has to know that you have standards 
2. Accepting her value offerings:
	1. If a woman offers to get you a drink, thank her and, if you’d like one, accept.
3. Rewarding her:
	1. When a woman responds well to a screen, or offers value that pleases you, or does something else you like, it’s extremely important to remember to reward her.
	2. Otherwise, she’ll begin feeling like her investing in you is going unrecognized, and will begin viewing you as too hard to get – no matter how much work she puts in, it’s not enough
4. Addressing her challenges:
	1. she’s testing how strong you are and how valuable you are. 
	2. It’s important that you respond to challenges the right way.
	3. Sometimes it requires you to challenge her back; or dismiss her challenge outright; or even address it in a non-supplicating way.
