You will likely want to avoid doing too much of it in public, for two reasons:
1. Her friends
	1. looking for her best interest -> will want to slow down intimacy and call you tomorrow. 
2. Her self-consciousness
	1. society taboo of getting very close to a man quicly. 

###### Kinds of romantic touch:
- Holding hands with fingers interlocked / interlaced. This is far more meaningful than other forms of hand-holding. The “fingers locked together” position very explicitly communicates “we are together”. This one is perfectly okay to do in public.
- Holding a woman up against your body. Social beginners who give this a try will find that this can actually be surprisingly easy to accomplish and do with a great many women. Simply take her hand, pull her in, and place your arm around her, all the while continuing to talk. It’s quite easy, and fun to do. However, be wary of this one in public – you might want to do it briefly, and hold for perhaps thirty seconds, then lightly push her away. Too much can be detrimental.
- Kissing. It’s such a huge cultural phenomenon, but it’s really a double-sided sword. My recommendation: avoid kissing in public most of the time. Publicly kissing a girl whom you haven’t slept with yet lets her know she “has” you, and removes much of the intrigue and desire she might have had to go home with you and find out what might happen next. 
	- Many women are satisfied at getting the kiss and will ask you to call them later. Then, you may see them again, or, more often, you may not. Better to wait to kiss them in private
	- Additionally, once you are already seeing a girl, kissing in public (if you are the initiator) can look and feel quite possessive and needy. If she wants to kiss you once you have been intimate already, it’s okay; but be sure to end it gently if she goes on kissing too much. If you have yet to be intimate, and she fishes for a kiss, you can lean in as if you were about to, then lean back and smile at her. Tease her a little bit. You can also tell her, “Not here,” to communicate a lot of good, powerful things in just two short words.
