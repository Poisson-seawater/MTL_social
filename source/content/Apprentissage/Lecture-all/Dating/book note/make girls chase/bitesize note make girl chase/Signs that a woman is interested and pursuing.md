Signs that a woman is interested and pursuing you:
- She’s physically leaning into you – the closer the better
- Her body is facing you
- She’s asking you lots of questions
- She’s proactively working to qualify herself and build rapport and a connection, including
	- She agrees with just about everything you say, very emphatically
	- She works to relate her experiences to yours and build commonalities
	- She focuses on ways that the two of you are alike in conversation
- She’s touching you
- She’s talking about things the two of you can or will do in the future (*such as hanging out, going to different places, or even taking vacations*)
- She uses “we” and “us” when referring to you and her
