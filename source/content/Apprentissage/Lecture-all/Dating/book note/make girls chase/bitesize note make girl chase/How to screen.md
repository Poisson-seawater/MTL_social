- **Questions**: the most basic form of screening. “Are you a good cook?” “What kind of creative stuff do you do?” “Do you play any sports?”
- **Comparisons**: more subtle, but still a obvious  screening
	- “All of my friends are travelers and adventurers,” 
	- or, “The people I like most are the ones who take charge of their own lives and go after the things they want.”
- **Self-Descriptions**. the most subtle form of screening. Making a statement like,
	- *“I'm a huge arts fan,”* or, 
	- *“I've always been a music lover,”* or, 
	- “*I think rock climbing is one of the best way to get outdoor"*
	- -> subtle way to encourage a girl to qualify herself to your screen.


##### Question 
2 respond to screening by question:
- reward: 
	- one more question to get to know more deeply 
	- Follow by a reward throught compliment, honesty and body language
- punishment:
	- don't ask questions right away.

#####  Comparaison
more subtle
put more social pressure on a woman to qualify herself than screening questions do, because comparisons are a stronger statement.


##### Self-Description
the most subtle and advanced means of screening.
It get right to the core of the conversation, the core of vibing and connecting, and ask her to connect with you. A failure to qualify in this instance is a failure to continue with the vibe of the conversation.
If a screening self-description is used properly, a woman will qualify herself to keep the conversation flowing.

###### Exemple 
Girl: My mom just recently went on this crazy kick, I don't know if it's a mid-life crisis or what, but all of a sudden she wants to go bungee jumping, sky diving, and anything else crazy she can think of.

Guy: I love a good adventure. Trying something exciting and different is the only way to force yourself out of those old boring patterns and make life fresh again.

Girl: You're so right. I've been feeling like I've been stuck in the same routine for a while, and I definitely need to do something different and crazy too.

Guy: But see, most people don't even recognize that. You're one of the few that actually gets it, you know?
