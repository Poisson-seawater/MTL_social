Have a frame, which is made of Belief & Habit <=> Boundary that stay strong. => express verbally your standard.
CAUSE woman will challenge it
AS a good frame make her feel secure !!

Woman frame is made of her personality and social narrative.

------ 
Frame: opinion, thought, plan ...  *ex: A student writes an essay he thinks is outstanding, but the teacher grading his paper thinks it’s mediocre OR A woman seeks a male friend, but the man wants to get intimate with her.*.

“meetings of frames” - when two people with different ideas meet each other’s ideas. In a  typical meeting of frames, one person’s ideas will supersede the other’s opinion.




[[frames]] – yours and hers
- [[strength of frame]]
	- It's your frame that allow you to succeed the girls challenge.
- [[responding to challenges]]

		- SO Shrug off challenges,
	- 4 ways to respond to challenge
		- Respond by [[Challenging]] her back (neutral)
		- emaining calm and [[Dismissal|dissmissing]] the comment <=> shrug
		- [[Self-Deprecation]]
		- Respond with an [[Invitational|invitation]].
		- [[Matter-of-Fact with Undertones]] -> Harryson Ford style
- [[ignoring unhelpful frames]]
	- frame only work when someone believe in it by doing such things are: surrender or fighting it. -> so ignore the challenge if you can't build something out of it
- [[rules of group management]]
	- group are most jugement full toward stranger than their own member.
	- First get the leader to accept you-> get to know her 
		- Trade a few pleasantries and a bit of small talk to at least seem likeable. 
	- Talk briefly with other members of the group as well.
	- cold approach the girl you like the most
		- then focus your attention on her 
		- WHILE talking with others,  by making polite, friendly small talk and expressing friendly interest without going too deep,
	- IF you done well, THEN they will leave you alone with her
	- One cardinal rule of managing groups: focus on one person at a time. => each one of them matter !!!
		- You must address individuals within a group, one at a time.
- [[hard push]]
	- idea of being extremly persistent
- [[a panoply of reasons]] - form of [[hard push]]
