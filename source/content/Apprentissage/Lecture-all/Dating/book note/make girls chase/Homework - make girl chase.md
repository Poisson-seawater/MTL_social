#### Meeting woman
p(49)
Choose three (3) venues you’d like to start meeting women at and visit all of them within a week from today. 

Then, choose three (3) separate openers – each of a different opening style – and use each one at least three (3) times. That’s a total of nine women spoken to across three different venues in one week’s time.


Once you’ve completed your first run of homework for this chapter, take a seat and choose some more openers to use, and more different kinds of venues. Review the section on [[the hook]] and [[openers]] and make sure you’re doing what you need to be doing after a conversation has begun to get women contributing and engaged in the interaction.


#### Reparte and Rapport
(p 90)
review 
- [[repartee]]
- [[rapport]]

First order of business is to focus on repartee
SO:
 - Take a small piece of paper, and write down two of your goals in repartee for an outing. Target those two goals and work on them as much as possible over a three hour period. Repeat this exercise with different or the same goals at least twice.
	 - *Take a small piece of paper, and write down two of your goals in repartee for an outing. Target those two goals and work on them as much as possible over a three hour period.*
	 - *Repeat this exercise with different or the same goals at least twice.*

2nd homework, working on rapport – that is, on building connections with women. For now, have simple conversations without worrying too much about the substance, and focus on making your stylistic tweaks. Your assignment:
- Take the same small piece of paper you’re keeping your repartee goals on, and write out two rapport goals 
	- For instance,
		- *A) Pay more attention to I, you, and we;*
		- *B) Talk more about emotions .* 
	- Work on these at the same time you’re working on your repartee goals.

After three outings, your repartee and rapport skills will begin to develop. Continue targeting these consistently for at least a month (**several three-hour outings a week for four weeks**).


#### [[value]]
(p141)

Step #1 – create a cheat sheet:
- Write down the two keys to value on your cheat sheet. 
	- You want to make sure you have these memorized and can recall them on the fly to see where you’re at. 
- You may also find it helpful to add Sebastian’s [[attainability]] questions to give yourself an easier time remembering how to best come off as attainable, along with the big four of attainability 
	- screening, 
	- accepting her value,
	- rewarding, 
	- addressing her challenges
- to keep you on-point in managing your attainability.

Step #2 – your in-the-field assignment:
- You are to spend at least three (3) outings of three (3) hours a-piece of active socializing  in one (1) week, focused almost entirely on value. We’ll break them down as follows: OUTING

**Outing 1**
- Work with explicit value –
	- how can you best convey value verbally without bragging or trying to impress? 
	- Make it a natural part of your conversation.
- Focus on attainability –pay attention to women’s reactions to you. 
	- Are they overly nice?
		- If so, you’re appearing too easy to get. 
	- Are they rude and resentful?
		- If that’s the case, you’re coming across as insincere, rude, or too hard to get.
	- Are they showing interest and attraction?
		- Then you’re doing things just right.

**Outing 2**
- Practice implicit value – how many ways can you find to show your value without stating it?
- Manage your attainability – pick a couple of things to target, and start tweaking to get to that place of balance.

**Outing 3**
- Start telling some stories – think a few up at home before you go out, and practice them.
	- It’s important to tell your story a few times to get it down and figure out the way you want to tell it – you can practice with friends, family, or even the women you meet out.
- Pick a few other aspects of attainability to include – are you noticing differences in how women react to you when you challenge them more and reward them for responding the right way?
#### [[investment]]
(p183)
On three separate outings,  your homework is going to be to try the three main types of compliance.

**Outing 1**
Use **compliance requests** and try asking women to give you
[[Compliance]] once you've been talking to them **for even a minute.** 
- Stuff like, “Can you hand me that pen?” 
- or, “Would you mind sliding over a bit?” are great places to start early on in an interaction.
- Make sure to **make at least three (3) compliance requests in this outing.**

**Outing 2**
Now try using **compliance demands**. As you're talking with women, intersperse some compliance demands in your conversation and see how they respond to you.
- “Let me see your hand,” you can say, seeking to inspect her ring or bracelet.
- “Come here, I want to show you something,” you can tell her, turning her to point something interesting out in the bookstore you're both in. 
- Make at least **three (3) compliance demands in this outing.**

**Outing 3**
Finally, you're going to try a little **taken compliance**. Once you have pretty decent fundamentals and women are responding well to you, try doing some taken compliance at the beginning of your interactions:
- Walk up to a girl leaning against a wall or a bar and gently push her aside to slide in next to her and start talking. 
- Take a woman's hand and pull her close to you as you say, “Hi.”
- In this outing, **two (2) instances of taken compliance** will do – but if you want to do more, by all means do so! 

Your objective should be to always continue progressing to the next level of compliance. 
- Try to go from **compliance requests** to **compliance demands**; and once you've made it there, seek to graduate to **taken compliance**.

#### [[attainability]]
(p220)

The first thing I’d like you to do is sit down for a little while and think about as many previous interactions with women you’ve had as you can.
- If things went bad or didn’t work out the way you’d wanted them to, think about the potential causes. Were you having value problems, or attainability problems? 

You will probably find that looking back at past dating and relationship scenarios through the lens of attainability sheds a lot of new light on past mistakes and opens up to you some lessons that you hadn’t yet learned from them.

Next, I want you to start paying careful attention to the women you meet, and ask yourself how your attainability is: 
- Is it good, bad, or average? 
	- Are women being conservative around you and trying to protect their egos, because they don’t feel safe enough letting their guard down around you?
	- Then it is an attainability problem.
- Are women being snippy or rude? 
	- That’s attainability too – snippiness and rudeness usually results from women seeing you as insincere. 
	- Pay close attention to how women are reacting to you and figure out why it is. 
- Think about what you’re doing might be causing them to react that way. 

Then try a little experimentation – use some of the attainability techniques from this chapter – and see how you can improve those reactions toward you.

#### Mindset
(p248)
Review
- [[her side and his side]]
- [[moving fast]]

**Exercise A: Compare and Contrast**
Go out and meet women in different modes. How do you find them to be different?
- How are distracted women different from women looking for a boyfriend?
- How are women in party mode behaving differently from women looking to get intimate?

Do some exploring and see if you can find out the contrasts. 

Talk to different women 
 - – at least five women who seem to be distracted or unsocial;
 - at least five who are partying hard; 
 - and at least five whom you notice are observing the people around them and look almost as if they’re looking for something and hoping to find something. 
	 - The latter are most likely to be in boyfriend-hunting or intimacy-searching modes. 
- Compare these three kinds of modes.


**Exercise B: Slow vs. Fast**
If you’re reasonably experienced with women, what I’ll ask you to do now is to look back on women you have lost. Not women you’ve had success with; but the women you wanted but never got. 
- How many of those women did you progress quickly with? 
- And how many of those women did you you move slowly with?
- What do you take away from the comparison?

#### Touch
(p265)
Review: 
- [[her side and his side]]
- [[moving fast]]

**Incidental Touch**: Use this right away with every woman you like. 
- To get started, write down three types of incidental you’d like to work with the next time you go out. 
- For instance, you might want to try out the cheek kiss upon first meeting girls, so that will be one of the items that goes on your list.

**Protective Touch**: You will mostly be using this when moving around with women, so won’t get the opportunity to practice it quite as much. 
However, it should also go on your list, and you should make an effort to use it and become familiar with it whenever you are moving from one place to another with a girl. There are also opportunities to use it while sitting or standing still – e.g., drawing a girl closer to you in a high traffic area so she won’t be bumped or nudged by passersby. 

You have lots of room to be creative here; use your imagination!

**Romantic Touch**: If you focused first on incidental and protective, you might come back to romantic a little later on. Though, if you’re bold, 
- THEN you can write down three of these to try out on your cheat sheet as well!

Romantic touch again is something best done in privacy or semi-privacy – the cab ride back to your place; the sofa when no one is looking; the bathroom or a private room if you can sneak away.

**Sexual Touch**: Review the kinds of sexual touch and have them in your mind, and keep in mind that even when you feel like rushing toward intimacy, you will often get there faster when your girl is more primed by your sexual touch


#### Dating and follow up
(p291)
Review
- [[getting her information]]
- [[getting in touch]]

Make it your objective to start collecting phone numbers. Take one of the following two goals to hit the next time you go out:
1. I will get two phone numbers
2. OR
3. I will ask every woman I talk to today for more than five minutes for her phone number


Then follow up as described in this section. You should aim to go on at least two meets per week – try it out this week and next week.

For your dates, sit down and figure out how you will structure them beforehand, and where you’d like to go. Here’s my favorite for girls that are already chasing me hard – 
- She arrived at my place 
	- and I had her come in and look through a bartending book I had and pick out a drink she’d like to try.
	- We headed over to the liquor store first, and I told her I’d get the liquor if she’d get the food.
- After stopping by the food store, we headed back to my place 
	- where she made dinner while I made the drinks. Then we sat and drank and ate, listening to music, and after dinner we became intimate.

The process of her arriving at your apartment, the two of you heading out elsewhere, then coming back again together really solidifies things and gives you a range of experiences together, even if it’s only your first date. And the fact that she’s at your place once, leaves, and returns makes it feel like she’s been there multiple times (because she has), so she allows herself to settle in and feel more comfortable the second time around.


#### [[frames]]
(p316)
How do you go out and try invitational responses? You need to incorporate them into conversations you have with women.

Write down “dismissal, “self-deprecation”, “invitational”, and “matter-of-fact with undertones” on a piece of paper, and take that with you. 
- If you’re having trouble coming up with responses that fall into these categories off the top of your head, take some time to write down some of the most common things you’re hearing from women right now, and how you’d respond in each of our four productive ways.

For instance, you might be hearing: “How old are you?”
- Dismissal: Old enough. So how do you spend your time in a big town like this..?
- Self-Deprecating 
	- (older): Well, let’s just say when your father and I used to play football in high school... [smile and wink]
	- (younger): Well, I’ll be able to join the army pretty soon, but it’s still going to be against the law for me to drink
- Invitational: Come a little closer and I’ll tell you, young lady.
- Matter-of-Face with Undertones: I’m ... [said in a whisper as you lean in with a seductive smile].

As you use these kinds of responses more, you’ll begin coming up with your own replies and using them on the fly in response to novel challenges from women and things you haven’t heard before. 

Also try using the [[hard push]] at least once the next time you encounter a situation where you’re asking a woman to do something and she’s giving you resistance. 
- See if you can turn that resistance into an opportunity to show her your persistence and determination, and win her over to your side.

#### [[making girls chase]]
(p338)
Have you been using pre-opening? . How about chase frames – using those? You should be. As these techniques are more subtle, they don’t seem to have as forceful instant results as things like upgrading your opening to opening direct. Regardless, they contribute to your interactions and bring a far greater degree of efficacy to your efforts with women.

Your homework is divided into two parts: 
  - observing
  - and encouraging.

**First**, go out and pay attention to how women are interacting with you as you get to know them. 
- Are they chasing you? 
- What signs are you picking up on?
- And, just as importantly, where in the interaction are you seeing those signs? 
- Are women chasing you at the outset, but by the middle they’ve stopped? 
- Are they neutral to you at the outset, but by the middle they’ve begun chasing?

You will learn a great deal about where you need the most work by paying attention to these signs.
- If women are chasing you in the beginning but not the middle, then initially they’re very interested in you, but by the middle you are losing that interest somehow. 
- Perhaps you’re telling them too much 
	- and coming across as a man trying to impress;
- perhaps you’re failing to encourage them enough for their interest early on, 
	- and they feel you’re too aloof. 

Regardless of what it is, you now are able to identify more easily where in your interactions with women you’re encountering difficulties, and can test out possible solutions to see what works. 

**The next part of your homework** is the encouraging aspect.
Go back and reread the part of this chapter on **encouraging,** and start doing more of those things with women who pursue you and less of them with women who don’t.

With those less cooperative women, try to get them to chase a little bit before you begin doing encouraging. 
- You want them to feel that feedback loop in action – they pursue, you reward that pursuit with encouragement.
- If you haven’t been working much on the chase dynamic before, you should start seeing some changes soon.


#### [[pulling, logistics, and intimacy]]
(p371)
Take a moment to run through your logistics. 
- If you meet a girl at your favorite place, and things go well, 
	- where will you take her, and how will you get her there?

Also take a moment to reflect on women you may have lost in the past.
- How many of those women did you lose due to missed escalation windows? 
- Think about what you could have done differently to capitalize on the opportunities those women gave you.

Now, for the in-field portion of the homework:
- I want you to ask two women to come home with you. You probably won’t actually be saying, “Come home with me,” for obvious reasons.

#### [[process]]
(379)

Build your process. Don’t put too many steps in – you only want a barebones skeleton that’s easy to remember and follow. Only the most basic, big steps that you need to take should be included. There are lots of important details – like screening and qualifying, punishing and rewarding, showing value properly, getting women to discover your value on their own, building intrigue, using chase frames, escalating physically – that should be left out of your process because these will just be things you learn to naturally do.

> Process is how you put it all together and start succeeding with women.
