### Why Women Are More Perceptive
1) Women are two to three times more perceptive at reading body language than men.
2) People with female-oriented brains can multitask, whereas people with male-oriented brains can do one thing at a time.
3) Women are more perceptive, but men can learn to become more sensitive and aware of body language.﻿


#### On gender behavior
Woman would be better at multitask, which allow them to be better at cold reading. 
Using 5 tones of voice changing, while men can only use 2.

Men understand the bigger picture while woman take notice of detail. This is why man don't see woman new hair cut. 

Cry baby test: video but no sound, men and woman had to guess what the baby want. 


### Men and Woman interaction
Men will mostlikely support other men solution.
While woman will mostlikely support other women emotion. 
-> This is due to the fact that men are more emotionless when talking, hence listener can't know their feeling.

When talking to a Woman:
- THEN use face as feedback and to support her emotion. 
- IF she talk about a stressing 
	- THEN listen and **support her emotion.**
		-  as a men, my most likely answer is a solution. -> DONT
- Woman can talk and listend as the same time.
	- SO when woman are talking, just talk, cause woman could be able to talk and listen in the same time.
		- While when men are talking, they take turn.
