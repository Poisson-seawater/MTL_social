-> [[The Rules for Accurate Cold Reading]]
### Body Language
“If people buy you, they're likely to buy what goes with you.”

1) If someone is comfortable with you, there's a good chance they'll give you a fair hearing and say YES to you.
2) People create 90% of their [[Preparing First Impression|impressions]] about you in under four minutes.
3) The art of reading body language is to read a person's emotional condition, 
	1) match it with what they're saying,
	2) and then look at the context and circumstances.
