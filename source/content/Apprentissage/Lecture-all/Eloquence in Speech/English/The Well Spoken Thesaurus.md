*note pour moi: oui rhétorique ressemble a bullshit -> manipulation; cependant, l'esthetisme reste non urgent mais important. Donc voir l' #King_Philo/eloquence et #New_moi/debat/rhetorical comme des outils de Beauté*

###### HOW THE BOOK WAS WRITEN
resolved to invent a way to improve his speech manner.
By doing so: whenever he would happen upon an eloquent word or phrase, he would write it down and pair it with what he would have said otherwise.

WHY: Autor finds himself inarticulated when He went back to study in Cambridge.

WHAT: Goal of the book
be articulate, show intelligence, eloquence while being understandable by Children !! (<=> not feel like an ass-academician)

#### Why vocabulary matter
###### Theory of Word and intelligence
> <=> possessing a larger vocabulary directly correlates with higher intelligence.
> -> One of the weighting for mastering this book.


##### Some Rhetoric
###### understanding of the word de-familiarization
-> rhetorical argument
De-familiarization is anything a writer does that is unusual or out of the ordinary. Writers and speakers de-familiarize what they say because they
want your attention, and they want to more effectively make their points.

One easy way to de-familiarize a point is to use a strategically placed expletive.
Think about it: If someone who never swears were to drop the F-bomb in public, you’d listen, and you’d remember what they said. Why? Because that sort of language would be completely out of the ordinary for such a person, and hardly in keeping with decorum. 
=> Such outbursts can be pretty head-turning—and eyebrow-raising—so they must occur as if by mistake.

###### Expletive
[expletive, wikipedia linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expletive_(linguistics))
-> rhetorical argument

can  be used when their corresponding euphemisms fail to convey the gravity of a specific point.





## The Seven Rhetorical Sins
Here are seven of the most common rhetorical offenses: 
1. Melodrama
2. Needlessnesss
3. Cliché
4. Pretension
5. Craftiness
6. Perkiness
7. Wordiness

#### 1. Melodrama: 
**Jacqueline Susann, Valley of the Dolls:**
The temperature hit ninety degrees the day she arrived. New York was steaming, an angry concrete animal caught unawares in an unseasonable hot spell.

This recalls that famous Seinfeld scene: “The sea was angry that day, my friends—like an old man trying to  end back soup in a deli.”

#### 2. Needlessness: 
**Lee Child, The Enemy:**
I was alone in a borrowed office. There was a clock on the wall. Itt had no second hand. Just an hour hand, and a minute hand. It was electric. It didn’t tick. It was completely silent,
like the room. I was watching the minute hand intently.
It wasn’t moving.

As Simon and Garfunkel used to say, it’s “The Sound of Silence,” not “The Sound of Complete Silence”—and for good reason.

#### 3. Cliché: 
**Steven King, Insomnia**
By then the ticking had grown very loud, and when Ralph lay in bed beside her on those hot sumer nights when even a single sheet seemed to weigh ten pounds and he believed every dog in Derry was barking at the moon, he listened to it, to the deathwatch ticking inside Carolyn, and it seemed to him that his heart would break with sorrow and terror.


While there is little harm in using an occasional cliché, they should never inform your prose or your speech. The only good cliché is the one you coin yourself.


#### 4. Pretension
**Elias Canetti, Crowds and Power:**
There is nothing that man fears more than the touch of the unknown. He wants to see what is reaching towards him, and to be able to recognize or at least classify it. Man always tends to avoid physical contact with anything strange.


Why would you want to rhetorically dismiss half the people on the planet every time you communicate some grand universal notion? What’s wrong with “humankind” or even the occasional “she” or “her”? Speak to everyone. It’s the twenty-first century.


#### 5. Craftiness
[Craftiness](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/craftiness)
**Glenn Beck, Common Sense:**
I think I know who you are. After September 11, 2001, you thought our country had changed for the better. But the months that followed proved otherwise. We began to divide ourselves and the partisan bickering that had been absent from blood donor lines and church services started all over again.

From this, the opening paragraph to Common Sense, if you didn’t know any better you would think that Glenn Beck was sorry to see our country divided. But don’t be fooled. Propagandists crave division, and come well versed in language designed to sow it. They exploit our fear of terrorists, our suspicion of science, our resentment of the “edumacated,” and our bias against other cultures, religions, races, and nationalities. They manipulate our opinions by hyping obscure fringe groups which then serve as unwitting foils to the propagandists’ more “moderate” views. And with that oft repeated whisper “those people think they’re better than you,” propagandists exploit our lack of self esteem, and dismiss as corrupt, arrogant, or misinformed anyone with whom they disagree. 
Whether you lean right or left, never let “common sense” deprive you of reason.

#### 6. Perkiness
**Janet Evanovich, How I Write:** 
Three people are actually responsible for writing this book. Alex, my webmaster daughter, is the third author. When asked if she preferred the money or the glory, there wasn’t a contest, so for design purposes Alex’s  name isn’t on the cover. Bad enough we had to fit Evanovich on once, much less twice!


#### 7. Wordiness
-> [wordiness](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/writing-center/writing-resources/logic-and-rhetoric/wordiness/#:~:text=Wordiness%20most%20often%20occurs%20when,tightened%20without%20loss%20of%20meaning.)
**Henry James, The Turn of the Screw** 
The case, I may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him.
