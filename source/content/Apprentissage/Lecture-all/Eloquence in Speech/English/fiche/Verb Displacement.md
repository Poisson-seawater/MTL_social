King type of note: 
Statue Connectivit√©: to do
---
Idea is to add "is" or "was" in front of verb. All while doing minimaliste sentence 
ex:
- He **died** in April. VS He **is dead** since April
- At first it was far away and no one could tell what the noise was. 
	- Then it stopped and we hoped it had been nothing or perhaps only the wind. VS 
	- Then it **was stopped**  and we hoped it had been nothing or perhaps only the wind.

Tips from author Hemingway.
