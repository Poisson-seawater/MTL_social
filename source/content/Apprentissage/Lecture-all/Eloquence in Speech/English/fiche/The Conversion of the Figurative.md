If someone were to empathize with you and say, “I know where you’re coming from,” 
they would be using a figure of speech, and so their expression would be considered **figurative**, as opposed to **literal**. 
-> If they knew where you were coming from literally, they would know where you had been an hour earlier, and that would be a little creepy

SO you can play with word to make the figurative sound more literal:
- (I remember once how I let myself) **fall in love**; ==now I always work with a net ==.
	- figurative = fall in love
	- touch of literal: ==now I always work with a net==.
- this sentence is interesting due to the way the second half implies a literal translation of the first
