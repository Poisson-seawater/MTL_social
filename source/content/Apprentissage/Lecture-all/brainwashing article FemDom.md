Most people like to believe that they have minds of their own and are free to think whatever they want. Then, back in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, famous psychologists like the Russian Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) and the Americans John B. Watson (1878–1958) and Burrhus F. Skinner (1904–1990) proved that this wasn’t the case. Watson established what is now called The Psychological School of Behaviorism, but what these scientists discovered wasn’t new. Religions and political institutions have been using these methods on people for thousands of years.

Modern scientists are trying to explain how the human mind works by likening it to a sophisticated computer. The big difference between a computer and the human mind is that a computer is totally passive; it only does what the programmer tells it to do, whereas the human mind is made up of two parts—the conscious and unconscious minds. The human mind is a self-programming computer, with the unconscious mind operating like a computer and doing exactly what it is told, while the conscious mind is the unconscious mind’s programmer. In theory, the conscious mind should be all-powerful, because the unconscious mind is totally obedient. But as we know, there are many cases where a very good servant or slave can become the master by being too good at their job. Throughout history, there are cases where rich and powerful people became totally dependent on their servants, who efficiently organized everything for them, causing their masters to no longer think for themselves and become lazy. Consequently, they became dominated by the way their servants organized their lives. This, unfortunately, is true of most people. The unconscious mind does such a good job of looking after the conscious mind that most people surrender control to it, allowing the "slave" to become the master. If a person does not actively program their unconscious mind, many others are more than willing to do it for them.

When we start to learn a new skill, like driving a car, we will initially turn the steering wheel, change the gears, and press the accelerator and brake consciously. Then, after repeating these actions several times, they become automatic. This is how the conscious mind programs the unconscious mind—any action that the conscious mind repeats multiple times is learned by the unconscious mind, which then begins to take over this action.

This shows us how important it is to take control of our unconscious mind and actively learn how to program it, instead of allowing other people to do it for us. We can achieve this by consciously repeating thoughts and ideas that we want our unconscious mind to absorb. Reading 'positive thinking' books can provide more information on this, as most of them recommend affirmations, which involve saying sentences to ourselves repeatedly; this helps create the habitual thoughts and beliefs we want to have.

## Nagging
The concept of feeding others the same idea repeatedly, or giving ourselves affirmations, is quite similar to nagging, which is something women often do with men. Therefore, nagging can be used as a powerful tool to influence men. This may come as a surprise to many women who have nagged their partners for years without success, but nagging can only work if used in a positive way.

Nagging works similarly to advertising. If a woman repeats the same message to her partner repeatedly, his unconscious mind will learn it, and he will begin to respond automatically to what she has programmed into his unconscious mind. Unfortunately, most women who nag tend to focus on negative aspects of their partner. While nagging is indeed a powerful tool for a woman seeking to influence her partner, it must be used correctly, which means learning to praise men.

Women have used this method for centuries in strongly patriarchal societies, finding that they can achieve their desires from men by praising them and pandering to their egos. For this reason, many dominant women might feel that using such methods is beneath them, as they see it as the tactic of more submissive women. However, positive nagging is more than just stroking a man's ego; it is a method of programming his unconscious mind to become what she wants him to be.


## Programming a man to obey orders
To Subjected to pointless orders someone everyday, will program his unconscious mind to obey without question.

Also, creation of ritual, by starting with something un-usual, like kissing one's feet, turn the mind of the submitted one into submission mode. 

## Hypnosis
The important thing about hypnosis is the giving of suggests, and it seems that suggestions can be effective, even when people are in normal
consciousness.

the importance of what he called presuggestion.
What he was talking about, is that the hypnotist needs to sell how powerful hypnosis is, to the person they are hypnotising, before even starting the hypnosis. In other words the hypnotist will start to give the suggestions while their client is in normal consciousness.


Use a slow and sexy voice and tell the subject to relax, and when he does feel very relaxed, (not knowing he is in a trance) you can then give him suggestions that he will be totally obedient to you.


## Dominance and Submission
the way men and Women see D/S, can be very different. Men have an instinctive drive to compete against other men. So in masculine terms the dominant male is also the winner.
So to a man D/S is all about winners and losers and to him it is right that, “the winner takes it
all”.

How Women see D/S can be very different because they have different instincts.
Women have maternal and nurturing instincts, so they don’t instinctively see relationships in terms of Dominance and Submission, but in the terms of the giving and receiving of love. To them the mother/child relationship is all-important and they tend to treat men as if they are children. When a mother has child she finds herself in the situation of becoming the child’s slave. Therefore when men dominate Women and demand they serve them, many Woman can accept it, if she sees her husband as a baby who needs to be care for and nurtured.


So the Dominant husband is seeing the relationship in terms of
winning and losing, with him as the winner, while the wife is seeing the
relationship in terms of mother and child. Even if the man is violent and abusive
with her, she can forgive him because babies can be cruel and ungrateful to their
mothers with babies keeping mothers up all night with their crying and throwing
tantrums to get their own way. So when a Woman continues to love a man even
though he may physically and verbally abuses her, he assumes she must be a
masochist, whereas she just sees him as a big baby.



Actors does  the ‘under the skin’ of the character they are portraying. This is
called ‘method acting’ where the actor, doesn’t try to act, instead they try to
convince themselves they are the actual character in the play or film they are in.
To do this they have to program their unconscious mind before the play or film to
take on this role. This means they have to imagine what it would be like to be
this person, and run through their minds all the thoughts and feelings this person
would have.
Once an actor has programmed their unconscious mind that they are the character
they are attempting to be, they then find that the body language, tone of voice
and the way they would react comes to them automatically.


The principles are very simple: you encourage and reinforce the
behaviour you want in your man and ignore completely any behaviour you don’t like.



## tips
###### to reprogram using naging
Before reprogramming someone's else unconsious mind, you have to
reprogram your unconscious mind 

To do this, it is a good idea to draw up a list of everything about your relationship and your partner that you like. Once you have done this, then make a
habit of reading this list a number of times every day. Also think about the list
during the day and perhaps you my find yourself adding to it or clarifying it so
it makes better sense to you. By doing this you will start to reprogram your
unconscious mind to see the positive aspects of your partner, so when you nag her,
you may find yourself starting to nag him in a positive way. Therefore
programming into her mind more positive behaviour of the type you want. The more
you can see the positives of your relationship, the more you will encourage these
positives in yourself and in your partner.


IF really angry, think of her as a dog. If you are training a dog you are far less likely to get negative about her behaviour, than if you are training a human being. This is because if a dog is displaying
anti-social behaviour, you a far more likely to see it in terms of his being badly trained.


a person who is dominated by their own unconscious mind, has
very little if any freewill, as they are controlled by their habitual thoughts.
Such a person has probably the same amount of freewill as a dog.
