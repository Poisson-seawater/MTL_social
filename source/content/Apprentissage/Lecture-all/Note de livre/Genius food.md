Good tips again brain fog, dementia and Alzheimer's. 

In the end, find the optimal genius lifestyle and the genius plan. 

Reminder, science is a process and not everything can be test with experience. So the ultimate déterminant is how I respond to a given change. 



## part 1 you are what you eat 

#### chap 1 the invisible problem
> genius food 1 : extra virgin olive oil 

##### Intro 
The way we live is bad for health and unoptimal for brain.

Industrial food bad, cause cheap calorie, no Nutriment and toxic additive. 

Need : new and challenge, change and stimulation. Connection to nature, good sleep patterns. 

Take control of (really important factor for health):
- Food
- Lifestyle 
- Sleep 
- Stress 
- Exercice / sport 


Important research : finger trial from Stockholm's Karolinska institutet. 

**inflammation** normally use by immune system to "spot clean" cuts and to prevent the occasional bacterial tourist from becoming a full bblown infection.
But widespread inflammation is harmful to the body.
And some food drive inflammation. 


**overfeeding**
Some food have been design to make you enter a "bliss point" beyond which self control becomes futile.

##### Extra virgin olive oil 
Have  A compound name oleocanthal, that simulate our body to repair.
Plus it also have a powerful anti-inflammatory drugs without side effect.  
Also good against Alzheimer. 

Job oleologist exist and job is to cultivate ultra premium extra virgin olive oil. 
Tips : 
Color of oil have no impact. 
Tast must be grassy (not greasy) cause oleocanthal is responsable for oil's peppery taste.  
Stronger oil can be spicy and make yourself coughing.  
Ensure oil is kept shield from light. And store in cool dark place.  


Your fat consumption impact your brain and your aging too.  

Exessive oxidation create inflammation and damage DNA. 
Oxidation is like our own zombies apocalyps. 
Too much iron may give more oxidation. 

Oil put into heat over and over destroy the good fat and become toxic. In restaurant avoid everything sauté and fried.  

Oils to avoid :
Canola 
Corn oil 
Soybean oil 
Vegetable oil 
Peanut oil 
Safflower oil 
Sunflower oil 
Rapeseed oil
Grapeseed oil 
Rice bran oil 


Note : omega 3 is extremely vulnerable to oxidation!!  Hence the issus with fried stuff.  

Omega 6 is the raw material for activation inflammation, our ancestor eat a ratio of 1 to 1 (omega 3 to 6).


Membrane of neuron and other cells are made out of phospholipids.  
And both omega 3 and 6 fight for a rent in this membrane. Hence importance of having equal amount of both.  

> Good stuff to eat : DHA!!! 
> and fish oil

Furan fatty acid or F-acid. Come with the package of eating fish and good for health. 

To have good ingestion of EPA and DHA :
Eat wild salmon and sardine, eggs (pasterise) and grass feed beef.  
Plus avoid polyunsaturated oil.
And if one day you lack of EPA or DHA, supplements with fish, krill or plant based algae oil. 

Then eat ALA  - plant omega 3 - from whole food source such as walnuts, flaxseed or chia seed.
But ALA convertion to DHA and EPA is really low. 
So better eat egg, salmon and low mercury fish such as sardine to get DHA and EPA. 


Monosaturate fat is brain best friend. It's chemically stabel unlike polysaturate fat. Source of it are avocado and macadamia nuts. Wild salmon and beef have a 50% Monosaturate fat. But the best is extra virgin olive oil.

Saturate fat are the best fat for high heat cooking. And can be eaten if present in whole food. 

Don't eat trans-fat.


Carotenoid is better absorb with fat. Just like extra virgin olive oil. Cause it is fat-soluble. 



#### chap 2 fantastic fats and omnioud oils 
> genius food 2 : avocados 

Avocado have the highest total fat protecting capacity of any fruit and vegetables. Source of vitamin E, and potent repository of carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin.

Scientists thinking we eat way less potasium than our ancestors.

Avocado have twice potassium of banana. 

Try one half of avocado every day. 

Pro tips:
 To keep avocado from getting bad, pop them in the fridge once ripe, and take them out when ready yo eat. 


#### chap 3 overfed, yet starving 
> genius food 3 : blueberries 

There is 15 000 edible plant in the world. 

Vitamine D, is easily found in chlorophyll, energy generating molecule that give dark leafy greens their color.

Some believe human use to eat 150g of fiber a day. Again 15g nowadays. 

Our 5 L of blood contain just 1 tea spoon of sugar at any time.

Any food that elevate blood sugar has the potentiel to increase glycation, and any protein exposed to glucose is vulnerable. 

Stick to the carb's that occurs naturally in high fiber food and have a low glycemic index and load. 

Glycation  = glucose exposure x time 

Glycation is really bad, it have a role in dementia and Alzheimer's. 

Too much Sugar in the blood is link to smaller brain and mess vocabulary. 
The sugar in your blood, may even indicate the rate at which we are aging. 

Vegetarian aren't safer from this due to the sugar they have from fruit. 

AGE's, the damaging aspect of glycation. Is bad. 
It can be seen by the eye due to the Maillard reaction. 
The best way to cook to avoid it is by streaming, sautéing or moist heat. 

When eating meat or fish, eat dark leafy greens to minimize age. 

Fructose don't rise insuline level, it directly go to liver and become fat. Plus it does brain damage like Parkinson if eat in excès. 
To much fructose fuck your gut and give you various maladis like reaction. 
Eat fruit is alright cause of the water and the fiber in it. Making you full and slowing down suggar progression. 
But carefull with fruit consumption cause nowadays they have more and more suggar in them.
And also fruit are suppose to be saisonnier. 

Do eat low suggar fruit. 

###### blueberries
Mixt all the type of berries : strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, billberries and blueberries. 

They are good cause they have flavonoids a class of polyphenol compounds. That can go through the brain membrane. 


#### chap 4 winter is coming for your brain 
> genius food 4: dark chocolate

Avoid white floor. Just don't eat that bro.

An abnormal blood sugar is a late marker of chronically elevated insulin. 

Insuline keep us from producing ketones which are good for the brain. 

FOX03, good to help you live longer by helping maintain stem cell pools in the body. It activate when the body have low insuline environment. 

Regular insuline spikes create lethargy after a meal. 

Amyloid beta, plaque the brain of Alzheimer's people. It is due to when insuline is elevate, out ability to break down Amyloid become weaker. 

Long story short it happen cause when we sleep, because of glymphanic system our brain become a dishwasher. 
So eat 3 hour before sleep. 

HOMA-IR > 2.75 is insuline resistance. 
And insuline resistance have bad cognitive impact. 

After workout, is the best moment to eat carbs. Cause your muscle pull sugar from the blood.

Food eaten alone or with other change how they go in the blood. It change the insuline spike. 

High carb low fat or low carb high fat are both diet use by population. Distinction between western and them, process carb and polymere oil. 

Meditate and sleep to reduce stress. 
To politely refuse, says I'm good. And you avoid bad food or drogue. 


#### Tips to buy cacao 
Process with alkali or Dutch process is to ban. 
It degenerate the phytonutrient content of cocoa. 

Take minimum 80% of cacao. 
Or make your own bar. 

## part 2, the interconnectedness of it all (your brain responds)

#### chap 5 healthy heart, healthy brain 
> genius food 5 eggs

Cholesterol is good, saturate fat too. 

LDL come from cholesterol and its  Really good for the body and the brain. 
However, it can be ill-deserve to your body. Like a road with cars (bad) vs a road with bus (perfect). 


Don't eat process grain even while grain. 
Avoid alcool, take more oil, don't eat add saturate fat. Do intermitentes fasting. 

One to 2 time a week, eat a higher carb, low fat post workout meal. When insuline sensitivity is regained, to "turn on" the liver's LDL recycling machinery. 
Eat stuff such as sweet patato of brown rice, cause low fructose option. 

Eat nitrate rich food. 


Some believe cardiovascular disease begin in the gut. 
Cause by lack of LDL making out gut bacteria capable of living our gut. Wich can be dangerous.
To have healthy gut,
- consume lot of fibers
- Eat raw probiotic containing food
- Get in lot of polyphenok
- Cut sugar 
- No process food and wheat (gluten)

Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 is fat soluble antioxidants that help keep oxidative in check. 


To quantify overall effectiveness of a drug: NNT or Number Needed to Treat and Number Need to Harm NNH. 


Eggs : 
Just be careful regarding oxidation. 
Cook them with low heat and keep them creamy or soft. 

Pasture > omega 3 enriched > free range> conventional




#### chap 6 fueling your brain 
> genius food 6 grass fed beef 

Engine of the cell, mitochondria. 
They use glucose and oxygen to produce fuel for our body. - > aerobic metabolism. 
One by product of glucose metabolism is reactive oxygen species (free radical or zombie from chapter 2).

Autphagy : liver take all the dysfonctional proteine when it run out of sugar and cut them into amino acid. To transform them into fuel. 
But growth hormone make sur we don't cut out muscle but instead, we burn the fat for fuel. fat burning release ketone bodies or ketone. 
Ketone can be call super fuel. Cause they create fewer zombie per oxygen. Plus they increase availability of.natural antioxidant. 
And in the brain ketone boosy level of growth hormone.



Baby are fat to feed their brain. Cause new born baby finish developing their brain outside. 


2 road to ketones creation:
- Intermittent fasting
- Ketogenic diet

##### intermittent fasting 
Cause our ancestor had food to catch. We didn't use to eat all the time from dawn to dust.

So 16h of no calorie intake then 8h window to eat. Done daily, it reduce insuline level and alove ketone. 

So the plan is no food at leat 2h after waking up (to help cortisol) and no food  3h before bed. 

##### ketonic diet 
Focus on minimalize insuline and increase ketone. By consuming 60 to 80 % of calori from fat, 15 to 35 % from protein and 5 % from carbohydrates. 

It mean sweet fruit, grain or potatoes are prohibited. 

Protein excess will be transform into glucose in the body. Dietary protein is also insulin stimulating, but way smaller degree than carbohydrate. 

This diet will help regulate insulin and glucose control in few days. 

##### genius plan 
Mixte of both, but allow carbohydrates to help for muscle gain (cause of insuline, it help muscle gain). 
And also it try to not take to much heavy cream. 
And try to keep the omega 3 to omega 6 ratio. 



##### note on creatine
Good for muscle, good for brain too. Body get it from red meat and fish. But will produce it itself if needed, problem. Création of creatine put stress on us so it's un healthy.

##### la suite en vrac as usual 
Carbs post workout to get thos glucose in our muscle.

During carbohydrate reduction, may lack of salt. Cause drop in insuline may deplete the body of sodium. So 1st week add 2g of salt then just 1g. 

Once you get into the genius plan, eating carb after workout will not interupt the fat adapted state of our body. 

Coconut have fat better suit for ketone generating. 

Grass fed beef
Cause they had all the nutriment and mineral you want to eat from them. 


#### chap 7 go with your gut 
> genius food 7 dark leafy greens 

Gut bacteria are more present on our colon, but they are here from stomach to botom. With different kind, like different specie in different country.

They like to eat fiber. 
Food full of prebiotic fiber : berries, leeks, jicama, kale, subchokes, avocado, spinach, arugula, garlic, onions, coffee, chicory, root, unripe bananas, raw nuts, fennel, okra, bell pepper, broccolis, radish, dark chocolate and sprouts. 

These nutricious fiber are really good fro improve mood, cognition and longevity. 

Bacteria from gut after eating fiber transform them as short chain fatty acid (SCFAs). Wich raise out level of BDNF wich promote neuroplasticity and slow neurodegenerative process. 
Bacteria waste are also good for anti-inflammatories. 


Bacteria gut also serve as training for immune systems. 

Gluten may be responsible for permeability of your intestin. Cause of the zonulin protein. 

Major depression may be an extreme form of sickness behavior. And sickness behavior may come from inflamatoria among other criteria. 

Probiotic patch permiability.
Eat probiotic like food: kimchi, kombucha and kefir and many more. 

Other stuff that increase permeability :
- Alcool 
- Fructose
- Chronic stess 
- To much exercice (see chap 10)
- Fat consume with sugar
- Process food additive


Probiotic good for mental health. 

Grain have insolube fibre while gut bacteria like prebiotic fiber. 


Way to maximixr gut diversity:
- Avoir antibacterial soap and hand sanitizers (use them in hospital)
- Embrace nature, go outside
- Consume filtered water
- Shower less and 1 shampoo a week 
- Buy organic product. 
- Avoid broad spectrum antibiotics 
- Adopt a pet 
- Slow down when you eat. 


Dark leafy greens
Goods one are :
- Spinache
- Romain lettuce
- Cabbage 
- Kale
- Mustard greens 
- Arugula
- Bok choy

Full of folate and magnesium. 
Good to help gene get repair. 


#### chap 8  your brain's chemical switchboard
> genius food 8 broccoli 

Goal of this chapter is to keep our neurotransmitters functioning. 

Glutamate and GABA, are like Ying and yang neurotransmitters. 

Glutamate is involvenin creation of new neurone. But too much is harmful. 

GABA inhibit brain overall level of excitation and inhibit Glutamate. 


Exercice increase and regulate level of both, while depretion decrease there level.
Hypothermic conditioning (like ice bath) help to make the balance too. 

Monosodiym glutamate,  aspartame and sweetener are bad for the balance.

Acetylcholine, good for REM sleep. Avoir anticholinergic drug harm full for acetylcholine. 

Vitamine D good for serotonin. 

Dopamine activity is reduce in ADHD cause they have fewer dopamine receptors.

Prolonged reduction of dopamine reduce dopamine sensitivity. 

Norepinephrine, the focus neurotransmitters. Exercise is good for it. Extreme temperature like sauna or cold bath increase their level. Cold water immersion is good to get focus back. 

Exercice good for ADHD too it is a natural cognitive enhancer for norepinephrine and dopamine. 

Protect the synapses by:
- Consumption of FHA fat from fatty fish 
- Extra virgin olive oil 
- Consume fat soluble antioxidant 

New experience to create new synapses. 
Fasting should clean your sinapses.
Avoid excessive simulation (see picture)

Http://maxl.ug/meditation

Brocolis and cruciferous (Brussels sprout, cabbage, radishes, arugula, bok Choy and jale) vegetables are very healthy. 
One reason is they have sulforaphane. 
It is a genetic modulator that activate anti oxydant  Nrf2. 
Nrf2, mop up oxidative stress. 
Young brocoli have 100xtime more sulforaphane than adulte one. But adulte are more nutritious. 
But myrosinase, one or sulforaphane component is destroyed by cooking. So add mustard powder rich of myrosinase to cancel. 

Brócolis spout can be self growth easily!! 



## part 3, putting yourself in the driver's seat
#### chap 9 sacred sleep (and the hormonal helpers)
> genius food 9 wild salmon 

While we sleep, we clean our brain. 
One way is through glymphatic clearance. 
Not eating 2 to 3 hours before sleep + omega 3 help the clearance. 

Ghrelin : hunger hormone
Eat 2 or 6 meal doesn't impact your metabolism rate. 
So better to eat fewer meal to avoid time under insulin. 


Leptin : the metabolic throttle hormone
It is the satiety hormone, regulate energy balance through the hypothalamus. 
Leptin is secreted by fat cell, the more fat you have, the more leptin you produce. 
Brain understand higher leptin as permission to burn more calories. 
However we can build leptin resistance. 

Great carb are sushi (rice), potatoes or high sugar fruit. 


Once fasting done, eat sometime carb allow an insuline secretation. And give you a nice leptin booster. Work only when insuline resistance have disappeared. Advantage given add energy, recalibrate mood and fast lost. 


Growth hormone (GH)
For adulte, role as a repair hormone. 
Also role in processing speed and mood. 

One way to boosting it, is through fasting, 24h is the best or someting between 16 to 18h. 

Sauna, two 20min session at 80°C separate by a 30 min cool off. 
Or 2 x 15 min at 100°C. But not too often, cause after the 3rd day of doing it, the increase of GH decrease. 

Bad habit decrease it production. 
GH produce during slow wave sleep. 


Cortisol 
Cortisol + insuline at the same time = cortisol fat burning shut down + catabolic effect on muscle. 
Better not to eat in the morning for cortisol. Or eat fat, protein and veggies only!! 


Wild salmon
Wild fish consumption reduce risk fokr cardio vascular disease, cancer and mortality. 
Wiod fish give cognition, memory and bigger brain. 
Sea food is good too. 

Salmon good cause it's low in mercury. 
Rich source of RPA and DHA omega 3 fat + astaxanthin. + switch on gene that protect DNA. 

Boil is good 

Diversity by : fatty fish. 



#### chap 10 the virtues of stress (or how to become a more robust organism)
> genius food 10 almonds

Alll being follow entropy. 
But we can delay it, by avoiding stress.
Especially chronic stress such as bad job, financial issus or sour relationship. 

Exercice increase neuroplasticity. 

Have at least 1h of moderate intensity Exercice / day. 


Main idea of spot  (simple)
Aerobic: long and slow effort.
Fat and oxygen burning, burn far more calories than the other. 

Anaerobic: fast and short effort. 
sugar burning

Exercice help hippocampus growth. While after 5th Decade hippocampus usually lose volume. 

The more you exercice, the more level of Klotho you raise (protein good for connection between the synapses). 

Everytime you hit *lactate threshold* => when your muscle start burning and trembling, you empty the carb stored in the muscle. Meaning you turn your body into energy sponge. 


Obese and insuline resistant patient should do hypertrophy. Cause they will create more muscle that will need energy and aborbe what they eat. 


The call to our body to grow stronger is signaled by a temporary increase in free radical-meditated stress, brought by exercise. 

Do both anaerobic and aerobic exercise. 
Avoid chronic cardio like forty five min run few time a week or too much marathon. Better to do a 90min - 120min of easy run than a 45 hard one. 


Sauna crear a heat shock protein respond, who act as a protein bodyguard. protecting other protein from misfolding, misfolding mean the protein become stranger to the immune system.

To boost BNDF a bit more, training in cold or hot temperature. 

Sauna also boost prolactin. 

Avoid chronic climate confort, and accept little chill. 

Some food give our cell stress, which is where all the benefits come from eating them. Like polyphenol food, they act like workout for our cell to fight antioxidants. 
Eat more sulfur-rich to better production of glutathione.

Apigenin, a phebolic find in parsley, safe, romarin and thyme, strengthen our synaptic connection. 

Broccoli sprout are rich in sulforaphane, an anticancer agent and help detox. 

Eat food rich on iodine. And you can eat raw vegetables (sometime). 


Almond, rich in vitamin E, polyphenol and previotic (for our gut). 


#### chap 11 the genius plan 

##### clear out your kitchen. 
Remove:
- All form of refined process carbohydrate
      - product made with corn
      - patato and rice flour 
      - dried fruit 
      - chips 
      - cookies and muffins
      - pizza dough 
      - granola bar 
      - honey mustard 
      - pancake
  
- All source of wheat and gluten
    - Bread 
    - Pasta 
    - Noodles
    - Soy sauce
    - Wheat
    - Oatmeal


- Source of industrial grade emulsifier:
     - Polysorbate 80 or carboxymethylcellulose


- industrial and process meats and cheese. 

- all concentrated sweeteners 
     - Honey
     - Maple syrup 
     - Etc


 - commercial cooking oils

 - non organic, nonfermented soy tofu 

 - synthetic sweeteners


##### Always good 
Avoid empty calories, if need add extra virgin olive oil 

Olive and fats: extra virgine olive oil, butter from grass feed cow, avocado or coconut oil

Protein : grass fed beef, poultry, pasture raised porc, bison, elk, whole egg, sea food and fat fish 

Nut and seef

Vegetable

Nonstarchy root vegetable 

Low sugar fruit 

Herbs, seasoning and condiment fermented organic soy 

Dark chocolate


###### sometime, with moderation 
Consume latter in the day and 3 to 4 serving a week. 

Starchy root vegetable 

Non gluten containing unprocess grains

Dairy: yogurt, heavy cream and hard cheese. 

While sweet fruit, best after a workout (carefull with dried fruit)

Légumineuse : beans, lentils...


Goal is 75 grams of net carbohydrates  max per day (total carbohydrates content minus grams of fiber). After the 14 days free. 

Meal planning:
Breakfast, best is just coffee or tea. If needed just fat, fiber and protein. 

Dinner, lots of veggies and source of protein. And extra virgine olive oil. 

Snack :
Blueberry
Jicama
Dark chocolate
Nuts and seed 
Beef or salojmon jerky
Celery with butter 
A can of wild sardines in extra virgin olive oil or water. 
Pastured pork rinds sprinkled. 


Note on nut milk, one without Polysorbate 80 and btw nut milk is really poor in terme of nutriement. Better to just eat nut. 

For organic, look up Environmental Working groups "dirty dozen" and "clean fifteen". 


Un teme of plate 
Most of calories from fat and most of the plate is vegetable. 

Eat every day a huge bowl of salade (salade as the name not the food). 

Issues with dairy. 
Milk protein is on par with white Bread in terme of insuline stimulation (good for baby for helping them get weight). 

Bovine milk protein metabolize into morphine like compound call casomorphin. That hace inflammatory effect on gut, plus interact with neurotransmitter. 
Milk lower urate. 
That's why the book recommand butter and ghee. If eat dairy, take full fat ones.


Dont touch gluteen free food that is suppose to have gluten in their natural form. 

Alcool, recommend to be sober. But if drinking:
- Always go to sleep sober
- One for one rule (water and Alcool)
- Make sur to replace the salt that is lost 
- Stick to red wine, white wine or spirit
    -  Beer have gluten
    - Spirit of choice one the rock or with soda water and lime. 
    - Avoid cocktail 
- Drink empty stomach 



Other tips : aluminium free deodorant
Take narrow spectrum antibiotics 


##### day 1 to 14: clearing the cache
Remove every process food. 
Ultra low carb phase. 
Net carbohydrates intake around 20 to 40 grams/day. 
Carb will come from veggies and low fructose fruit. 

During the first week, may need to add sodium (1 tablespoon) and 2nd week (1/2 tablespoon). 
Also no more than 1 or 2 coffee / day and never after 2pm. 

##### day 15 and after 
Body is now use to burn fat for fuel. 
So we can eat carbs again (insuline and carb are good, just in reasonable amount) for upregulation hormone and refilling muscle with stored glycogen. 


##### custom carb pyramid 

Recopier les photos 

#### recipes and supplement 
Oeuf, le feu le plus bas possible pour les faire le plus mousseux possible et les sortir un peu avant car ils continuent de cuir. 

Rajouter, sel, épices et herbes au max!!! 


Add to diet: fish oil for EPA/DHA
DHA 500 milligrams and EPA 1000 milligram daily. 
Always check if the fish oil is good quality, ie, huge ratio of EPA and DHA per oil. 


Vitamine D, important for DNA protection. Daily intake: 2000 to 5000 IU of vitamine D3 per day. 
Every 6 months check level between 40 to 60 ng/ml. 

Up to 50 to 100 micrograms of K2 MK-7 daily. 

500 to 1000 milligram of turmericb/day with bleck pepper 

Astaxanthin: fat soluble, so eat it with fat (it's a carotenoid) 12 milligrams / day


Prebiotic, take one with source of prebiotic fiber + 5 to 10 billions CFUs
