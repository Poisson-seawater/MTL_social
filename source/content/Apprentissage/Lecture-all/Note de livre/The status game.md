The status game play on 3 fields (can mixe them & change through out the day):
- dominance game
	- status is gain by fear or strength (*a bully or a MMA fighter*)
- virtue game
	- status is gain by moral, duty, ... (*ex priest*)
- success game
	- status is gain through achievement


Status "score" happen in 129 secondes by:
- number of eye contact
- facial marker for dominance and submission

#### Losing "Face"
According to sociologist Professor David Yau Fai Ho, there are three ways it’s possible to lose face:
1. When "one fails to meet others’ expectations associated with his/her social status".
2. When "one is not treated by others as respectfully as his/her face deserves".
3. When one’s in-group members (e.g. family members, relatives, immediate subordinates) fail to meet their social roles".

#### Elemental rule of "tribal" society
These elemental rules dictate how humans keep their tribes working well and provide basic instructions for life. They represent a shared humanity and are stored in DNA.

These rules include:
- Help your family
- Help your group
- Return favours
- Be brave.
- Defer to superiors,
	- meaning being deferential, respectful, loyal or obedient to those above you in a hierarchy, using appropriate forms of address and etiquette.
- Divide resources fairly, 
	- including being willing to negotiate and compromise.
- Respect others’ property.

### Prise de note durant lecture dans le métro
> j'ai arreter de lire le livre en réalisant que tout les chapitre ne sont pas tant intéressant. Donc j'ai continuer ma lecture en utilisant [[NotebookLM - IA|NotebookLM]].


Reputation = symbolic version of us in the mind of others. 
On way our reputation is kept alive is thought gossip. 

##### chap 6 
There are 4 trigger to give status to someone else.
They are:
- **Self-similarity cue**:  People tend to think they will learn useful lessons from people like themselves. 
	- There is an inherent preference for those who share age, race, and gender.
- **Skill cues**: Demonstrating knowledge and skill can benefit others. 
- **Prestige cues**: Analyzing body language, eye movements, and voice patterns of co-players to see who they're deferring to, as well as detecting clues in the behavior of prestigious people themselves.
- **Attention**: People pay attention to those who others are paying attention to, creating a feedback loop that can elevate individuals to planetary status; this is referred to as "The Paris Hilton Effect"


##### chap 7 - dominance 
I can see status game, when one lose his cool and act like an idiot, as Ego taking control. 

Dominance younger brother is prestige. Both have a specific non verbal associate with it.
Dominance game is triggers by not much, and the phrase "for the principe" is a sign of feeling that status have been attack. Men respond with physical violence whereas woman with statu attack usually (commérage sur beauté et une pute).


##### chap 8 - statu and humiliation
Humiliation is described as the inhalation of the self. Because it attack our need of status and of connection.
To happen, it have 4 states:

4. The individual believes they are deserving of status. 
	1. *like QI well above average*
5. Humiliating incidents occur publicly.
6. The person causing the degradation possesses some level of status.
7. There is a rejection of the ability to claim status, or rejection from the status game.

##### chap 9 
Status is important vis a vis of our close cercle (collègue, friend, family ...). Status come from different valuable skill, cooking, honey, medicine ...
To much fight for statu creat rivalry. Which is a too high level of completion, et devient contre productif.


##### chap 10

Fogg behavior model.

##### chap 11
Status drunkenness est ce qu'on peut comparer a un ego démesuré qui demande plus et fait des actes très "inhabituel". Ainsi que tout les risques associés.


### Hidden rule of status game
The 'hidden rules of status games' involve understanding the subtle, often unconscious, dynamics that drive human behavior in social contexts. These rules dictate how individuals seek connection and rank within groups, striving for approval and acclaim to maximize their potential for survival and reproduction. Here are some key aspects of these hidden rules, based on the sources:

- **Subconscious Motivation:** People rarely explicitly acknowledge that their actions are driven by status. The desire to improve one's rank is often concealed, as admitting it can risk others thinking less of the individual, thereby lowering their status. This awareness of the desire for status often "eats itself".
- **Status Symbols:** The human brain assigns values to objects and behaviors as status symbols to gauge rank. These symbols, such as a Cartier watch versus a Casio, or even the amount of orange juice poured in a glass, provide cues about how individuals are performing in the game of life. The subconscious uses a 'status detection system' to read these cues and assess status in the environment.
- **Group Dynamics:** Humans are programmed to seek groups and strive for rank within them. Connection is the minimum requirement for playing; acceptance into the group must occur before status rewards can be obtained.
- **Influence:** Influence is a reliable symbol of status. High-status individuals often exert outsized influence, which can be measured by how much they talk or how others defer to them.
- **Policing:** Within status games, individuals police each other to maintain fairness and stability. There is an incentive to manage "big shots" to ensure the game remains equitable.
- **Virtue and Success:** Status can be earned through displays of virtue or success. People showing value to their game through virtuous or successful behavior will be noted by co-players. Submissiveness and copying behaviors are given as rewards.
- **Moral displays:** Displays of morality are used to manufacture status because virtue is the bribe that nudges people into putting the interests of co-players before their own.
- **Tyranny:** Tyrannical games are virtue-dominance games, focusing on obedience, belief, and enemies.
- **Dreaming:** A status game is a conspiracy to make ourselves feel important, so we concoct symbols like deference, influence, money, and clothing.
- **Hierarchy of games:** Life should be organized as a hierarchy of games to earn the prestige we desire, with the top game drawing the most effort and generating maximal meaning.
- **Rules encoded in culture:** Every culture has distinct rules that its members should live by. People are judged on how well they play by them.

These hidden rules highlight that the pursuit of status is a complex, often unconscious, game that shapes human behavior and social structures. Understanding these rules can provide insights into why people act the way they do and how societies function.


### Chapitre a approfondir


#### Chapter 20: Victims, Warriors, Witches
Focuses on the archetypes that emerge in status games, such as **victims**, **warriors**, and **scapegoats**.
Those roles people play in status games have intensified into conflicts: victims, warriors, and perceived deviants ("witches"). To gain status and reinforce the game's self-serving narrative; when status games escalate to a war-like state.


Narratives of victimhood, displays of zealous defense, and the scapegoating of "witches" are used to solidify group identity, justify actions, and gain status within the game.

how This Happens
- When a game goes to war, it tightens up and strengthens its dominion over individual players.

- Players who tell tales that reaffirm its self-serving narrative are rewarded with status, often through accounts of victimhood that depict foes as heartless and dangerous.

- Players may even invent accounts when reality lacks them.

- Warriors on the opposing side also emerge, further solidifying the division.

- The game tightens as players pressure one another to cover up doubts, increasing suspicion and potentially leading to a "purity spiral," where members are condemned for minor deviations.

- The inquisition's dominance-virtue play was rewarded, darkening their dream of reality and making their perception of enemies sociopathically vindictive.

- Threats from rival games help motivate by increasing the poisonous narrative of prejudice.

- Ultimately, the chapter likely suggests that breaking free from these destructive patterns requires recognizing the underlying status dynamics, challenging simplistic narratives, and fostering empathy and understanding.

#### Chapter 22: Status Generating Machines
Examines how organizations and institutions create and reinforce status hierarchies


#### Chapter 24: The Road Out of Hell
Explores potential solutions for mitigating the negative effects of status games. While improve our lives and defend ourself from the terrors of status game.





#### Chapter 25: The Neoliberal Self
Examines how neoliberal ideology has shaped our understanding of the self and our pursuit of status.

Current West ideology push people to go to perfection and competition. While both consequences are negative for humain like anxiety and depression. 
- the neoliberal emphasis on self-reliance and personal responsibility can lead to feelings of guilt and shame when individuals fail to meet societal expectations


#### Chapter 26: Fairness, Unfairness
Discusses the challenges of creating fair and equitable status games.

The chapter's main argument likely centers on the idea that our understanding of fairness has been radically revised since the last century (abolition of slavery, woman equality to men...). 






#### Chapter 27: When Dreams Collide
Explores what happens when different status games come into conflict

- The chapter suggests that conflicts arise because people are often unaware that they are playing a "status game" and that their beliefs are not necessarily objective truths
- People often seek to dominate those who hold different beliefs, trying to impose their own worldview on others
- Ambiguous remarks may be used to test where others stand in the game


#### Chapter 28: The Parable of the Communists
> This chapter explores the theoretical concept of a society without status and examines the practical attempts to create such a society through communism

Explores the status games within communism, including the consequences and pursuit of equality. That is translate by refusing status game. However, this level of society engineering fail because status is part of human nature and trying to delete it just create a new status game more devasting. 



#### Chapter 29: Seven Rules of the Status Game: 
Offers practical advice for navigating status games in a healthy and constructive way

**Why**: The chapter addresses the need for guidance in a world where status games significantly mold our perception of reality. It recognizes the potential for these games to become destructive, leading to tyranny and unhappiness.


###### Argument and Weight Against the Status Quo

The chapter argues that by understanding the underlying dynamics of status games and adopting these seven rules, individuals can avoid the pitfalls of delusion and tyranny, and instead, work towards a fairer, wealthier, and higher quality of life. This challenges the status quo by encouraging individuals to be more conscious of the games they're playing and to actively work towards creating more positive social interactions.

The ideas in this chapter stand in contrast to the often unconscious and automatic ways in which people engage in status games, where the pursuit of rank can lead to competition, exclusion, and even violence. By providing a framework for more mindful engagement, the chapter seeks to disrupt these patterns and promote more equitable and cooperative social dynamics.

##### Seven Rules of the Status Game:

###### Practise Warmth, Sincerity, and Competence: 
When interacting with others, conveying warmth, sincerity, and competence can positively influence how others perceive you and increase your status. 
- Warmth implies you won't use dominance,
- sincerity suggests fair play, 
- and competence indicates you'll be valuable to the game.

###### Create Small Moments of Prestige: 
Seek opportunities to **create small moments of prestige for others**, as it costs nothing and never runs out. 

**WHY** Allowing others to feel statusful makes them more likely to accept your influence.

###### Know What Game You're In: 
Recognize the dynamics of the game you're playing to avoid being seduced by destructive patterns. Tyrannies often involve coercion, silencing ideological foes, and demonizing enemies.

###### Trade-Off Mindset: 
Rather than fighting to make moral truths absolute, foster a trade-off mindset, viewing the world in terms of groups negotiating trade-offs. Empathize with your enemies and acknowledge their criteria for status.


###### Be Different: 
Engage in minor acts of nonconformity that don't violate basic standards but attract attention. Originality makes it harder for rivals to catch you, offering an alternative to obsessing over perfection.

###### Never Forget You're Dreaming:
Recognize that status games are constructs we create to feel important.

###### Reducing Our Moral Sphere: 
Acknowledge that complex phenomena have positive and negative effects.
