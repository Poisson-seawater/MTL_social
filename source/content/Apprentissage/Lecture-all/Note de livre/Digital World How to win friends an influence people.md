#### why Carnegie's advice still matters 
When you leave someone, you leave him a little better or a little worse. 

Be interest in other people. 

Build message that build trust, convey gratitude and add value to the recipients. 

Distinction between influence that is borrow (and difficult to sustain) and influence that is earn. 

How to consider other need in conversation :
- Don't criticize
- Don't condemn
- Don't complain
- Talk about others' interests 
- If you are wrong, admit it
- Let other save face

People are moved when their interactions with you leave them a little better. 

Find something meaningful to offer, then choose the media. 


### part one, essentials of engagement 

#### chap 1 : Bury your boomerang 

With Internet, it's easy to get trouble with what you post. 
Think about employee who get fired for a tweet. 

Example of Lincoln who didn't send a letter to Meade after his mistake. And choose to extend his influence with him instead. 

Never condemn, use sarcasme or orcriticism. 
Cause you create defence, hence losing the opportunity to lead, explain or teach. It also diminished your ability to communicate something to someone else. 

Just focus on your growth. 

When you are sharing information (your employee or board of direction...) no one wants a barrage of what's important to you.  They want value.

If I am the problem with the world and you are too, then we can stop worrying about who is right and get on with the work of making our world better.


#### chap 2: affirm what's good

When talking to someone remember, "the ancestors of every action is a thought". 

Affimation, in contrast to flattery require seeing someone well enought to sense what to affirm, knowing someone well enough to be aware of why really matters.

Use affirmation with other people.

Focus about each person best moment and sought to affirm it to them. 
Remind people the sucess of their history. 



#### chap 3: Connect with the Core Desires
To influence others to act, you must first connect to a core desire within them. 

Influencing is a matter of trully discerning what people want and offering it to them in a mutual beneficial package. 



### part 2, six ways to make a lasting impression 

#### chap 1 : take interest in Others' interests

Try to see the world from the other one point of view.

Take interest in other interests. 

Go after relationship especially in business.

Be the go to guys when people need someone.

Check NASCAR. 


1. Human relations are always easier when they begin from a place of affinity. 
2. The potential for relational connectivity is astronomical.




#### Chap 2 : smile 
Smile is an important social aspect. 
Happiness is merely a function of personal experiences but also is a property of groups.

Always begin and end message with a positive note. 

Between two people, there is always a reason to smile. If you can't see the reason, you need to wait before writing or not write at all. 

Tone and action speak loudly!! So play your emotion with your non verbal. 

People tend to hangout with people that have the same emotion as them. 
So on communication, use appropriate tone, vocabulary or emoji. 

Smile even on telephone or when writing, it will give you the right tone and vocabulary. 


2 kind of people, those who see internet and technology as attached to human feeling and those who think not. The 1st group is right, people can be attached and display emotion at distance. 



#### chap 3 : Reign with names 
Im littérature à person name is a revelation of the caracter, personality, physical trait and destiny. 

Remembering people name and there story have deep impact on relationships with them. 
Need great relationships to build a business and put some good branding.

Exemple of Lincoln calling a friend from Illinois to just do all the talking about his problem. Then Lincoln find his solution. He just needed someone to open to. 

Who can resist being around a person who suspends his thoughts in order to value yours??? 

Description of Freud, one of the best listener :
"but the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what I said, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary l. You've no idea what it meant to be listened to like that."

Be present : "whenever you are, be all there". 
To increase presence, ask 15 questions a day. 
The most important 5 are to family and  close friends. 
Ask about people day. But go deeper. 
Ask what make them laugh or what make them cry. 
Ask about something they learn. 
Ask about person they meet that they like. 
Then questions for people you work with, just ask with sincerity, respect and interest. 
Last 5 questions are for digital space.

Add meaning and value 

You always leave someone a little better or a little worse.
Like a nice compliment.

Check Billy Graham. 
When he was invited to a pub for a chat, he never responded to the clash, nor fight back. But he ended up making new friend instead. 

Tension occur when you forget that other person have an inner wisdom too. 

Best idea comme when people exchange and implement their views and idea. 




#### Chap 2 Nevers say, you are wrong
Most conflict came for misunderstanding. 
Hence we should alway empty our mind before.
Enter dispute with open mind so you can create solutions from blank. 

Saying to someone he is wrong will make him react emotionally. So avoid it at all cost or you will gain a enemi.

#### chap 9 : share your journey
Exemple of TOM shoes, when the entrepreneur ask a random girl at the airports about her shoes. And she give him a huge speach about the company.
