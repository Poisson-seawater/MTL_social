Four step model of Habit (4 law of behavior change):
- cue
- crawing
- response
- reward


# 1.the fundamentals 

## why tiny changes make a big difference 

### the surprising power of atomic habit 
Story of the British cycling team, the coach device to improve every 1 % he could find. 
Like how to wash hand to paint in white to better see the dust.
Result was they dominated the competition. 

Think exponentially, 1.01^365 = 37.78

Take care of the step instead of the result.

### what progress is really like
Think of a bambou, first 5 years, it build an insane root system. Then, it grow extremely fast. 

Habit take time, just like earthquake. It need to accumulated then it result happen. 

The curve of Habit is an exponential function. But start to grow after a couple of years. 


### forget about goal, focus on system instead
Focus on specific process / designing system, instead of goal. 

Remeber, achieving a goal is only a momentary change. Think about cleaning a messy room, have to change the habit to not have to clean again. 

Carefully of the logical fallacy : once I achieve that goal, I will be happy. 

Fall in love with the process. 

Goal are at odds with long term progress. Idea is when you achieve your goal, what else going yo motivate you?? 

### a system of atomic habit 
Atomic for small habit that create molecula, ie life. 

Note : habit can work against or with you. 



# 2. How your habits shape your identity (and vice versa)

Changing habit is challenging, for 2 reasons
1. We try to change the wrong thing 
2. We try to change our habits in the wrong way

About changing the wrong thing; 3 level at which change occurs. 
1. Identity = your belief, your why 
2. Process = the system you use
3. Outcome = the goal 

Have to change who you are, to change life and succed in a goal. 
Ultimate form of intrasic motivation is when a habit become part of your identity. 
Once pride come in, intrasic motivation. 

Not tu avoid the negatives effect of this, ie bad habit, have to destroy one's ego. 

Éthimologie speaking, identity (form latin) is literally "repeated beingness". 

Goal is to win a majority of Habit, ie a majority of small action you do every day. 

Question : "who is the kind of person that get what I want??" 
And become this who. 


# 3. how to build better habits in 4 simple steps

When brain try something new, it goes to trial and error until it reward. 
Then Brain try to understand what was the right action and get rid of the useless one's. 

" Habit are reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment" - Jason Hreha. 

Brain remember past to better predict futur. 

Goals of Habit is to do stuff automatically so brain can focus on other stuff. 

Good habit creat freedom by giving you more time.

To be create all habit start by the four steps, 
1. Cue 
2. Craving 
3. Respond
4. Reward

Cue trigger the brain to initiate a behavior that will give a reward (for the primary part of the  brain, survival). 

Because cue is the 1st indication for a reward it lead to carving.

Carving is the motivation force behind every habit. 
One crave for the change the habit delivers. 

Cue are meangless unless it is interpreted. It is the feeling, though and emotions that transform the cue to a craving. 

The respond is the actual habit you perform, can be though or action. 

Reward are the end goal of the habit.
We chase reward cause
1. They satisfy us
2. They teach us what to remember 

Need the first 3 step to make a habit occurs. 
And all the 4 do it's repeat. 


Thus creating the habit loop. 


Behavior are driven by desire to solve problems.


##### the four law of behavior change 
To creat habit effortlessly. 
1. Cue, make it obvious
2. Craving, make it attractive 
3. Respond, make it easy
4. Reward, make it satisfying 

Invert the law to learn how to break a habit:
1. Cue, make it invisible
2. Craving, make it unattractive 
3. Respond, make it difficult 
4. Reward, make it unsatisfying 



# 4. The man who didn't look right
Gain awareness on what you are doing. 
For example make a list of everything you do routinely and check if it a good habit or a bad one. 
Just point them out and decide if this is a outcome you would like to keep. 

To cut a bad habit. Notice it, then express out loud what you are going to do and it outcome. 

Key idea : acknowledge and awareness. 

# 5. The best way to start a new habit 
Implement intention That leverage time and location. So I will "behavior" at "time" in "locations". 

You don't lack motivation, you lack clarity. 

Be specific about what you want and how to achieve it. 
Make it obvious so that with a little repetition, you get a need / crave to do it. 

#### habit stacking, a simple plan to overhaul your habit
Just like the Diderot Effect 
You decide what to do next base on what you just finished. 

Pair habit with time and location AND with another habit 


One techniques, 1st right à list of your habit and a 2nd colomn with what happen to each day without fail. Like sun rise, music end... 
Now you have a when to implement new habit. 
Be specific. 


# 6. Motivation is overrated; environment often matters more
Behaviour us the function of the person in their environment B=f(P, E)

Also vision take a lot of space in our brain, so vision cue are important. 
Architect your habitat to get your habit. 

#### the context is the cue 
Over time, habit get trigger mot only with a simple trigger but with entire context surrounding the behavior. 

It is easier to associate new habit with new context, like going to a new café or using a new bench at the Parc => "no competition of cue"

Remember, every habit should have a home. One consequence is try to separate place, a place to eat, to cook, to study... Each one happen at a different location. 


# 7. The secret to self control 
Structure your life in a way that doesnt require self control and willpower. Remove temptation, such as object but also place and people. 

Be careful, you can break a habit but you are unlikely to forget it. 
Remember, habit are neurone patterns in the brain that associated a stimuli to a reward. 
So to avoid energy in discipline. Make the trigger invisible. 
It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it. 

### how to create good habit 
1. Fill out the habits scoreboard. Write down your current habit to become aware of them. 
2. Use implementation intention "I will behavior at time in location"
3. Use habit stacking "after current habit, I will New habit"
4. Design your environment. Make thr cues of good habit obvious and visible 

How to break bad habit:
1. Reduce exposure, remove the cue of your bad habit from your environment


# 2nd law, make it attractive

## 8. How to make a habit irresistible 
Concept of *supernormal stimuli*, some animal react to a stimuli as if they where program to. and sometimes the bigger the stimuli the bigger the respond. Example from a little kind of bird. It egg have the tendency to roll out of the nest.  If you put round object near the nest, the bird will automatically put it on it nest. It even work with a volleyball. 


Experience with dopamine, the block dopamine in rat brain. And rats died of thirst. Because for every action, there is a desire. 

Also, dopamine is release when you experience and aniticiare pleasure. 
Scientific refer to it as the difference between "wanting" and "liking". 
And "wanting" take a larger part of the brain. 


Hence strategy of temptation bundling. 
#### how to use temptation bundling to make your habit more attractive 
Example, one need to exercice and love Netflix. That person hack his computer and stationary bike so he need to always stay at some speed if not, the show would pause. 
He employ temptation bundling, he bundle the think he want, Netflix ; with what he need, exercise.

It's an apply of Premarck's principle "more probable behavior will reinforce less probable behavior". 

Stacking  temptation bundling 
1. After current habit, I will habit I need
2. After habit I need, I will habit i want 

Habit are motivation driven feedback loop. 
The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. 

## 9. The role of family and friends in shaping your habits

The story of the Polgar sister. As an attempts to proof that a genius is made, not born. 
The 3 sisters became incredibly good as chest and hold many world record.

#### the seductive pull of social norms
Nos 1ère habitude sont celle de notre famille. Et elles impact nos skills socials. 
Social is our way to survive, "the lone wolf die but the pack survive". 

We imitate the habit of those 3 group:
1. The close 
2. The many 
3. The powerful

Those groups impact the 2nd law of habit change: craving (because belonging allow surviving). 

The close:
Proximity and cue impact our habit. 
So join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior and you already have something in commun with the group. 
Remaining in the group after gaining the habit is crucial too to keep it in the long run. 

Example of their impact and the will to fit in, when our mom come in, we clean cause we don't want to be judge. 

The group:
The opposite true too, study in chimpanzees show that when a chimp from a group use a more efficient of cracking nut. 
And then that chimp goes to a group using a mess efficient way of cracking nut. That chimp use the less effective way to fit in. 

Link to law of power, better not wining the argument and preserve the group an your place in the group. 

The powerful:
For our brain, the greater the status, the greater the acces to ressource 

Steps : once we fit in, we want to stand out. 

## 10. How to find and fix the causes of your bad habits

Each axtioon you do, come with a deeper motivation from the underlying motive of human nature, most of the time, we don't creat new motivation. 
*Ex: using tinder come from desire to find love, reproduce and get reckonize.* 
<=> your habit are modern day solution to ancient desire. 
So your current  habit may not be the most effective way to answer that ancien desire. 

Also, you are rarely reactive, most of the time you are predictive (ie answering to cue). 

Every action is base on a cue, that create a feeling that trigger a reflex (habit). 
And every action is tinged with the motivation to feel different, to change your current emotional state. 
Because feeling tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. In the idea that emotion tell us something is good, bad or indifference. 

So to keep a habit, associate them with a positive feeling. 

##### how to reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits

Associate a hard habit with a positive experience, instead of "have to", "I get to". It become a n opportunity. 
Highlight benefits of the Habit.

There is no verbosity, there is adrenaline rush to help you. 
Can also create a ritual, like a cue that put you in the mood for, example music you always use when sex, then when putting it it give you the mood for sex. 
Or headphones are use when studying, just putting your headphones on put you in mood to study. 

Can do simple thing such as breath and really fast meditation. 

##### how to create a good habit 

1. Fill out the habit scoreboard. Write down your current habit to become aware if them
