## The 4 Law
1. cue
2. crawing
3. response
4. reward

> Find the WHY and the DESIRE


The most effective way to change your habits is to ==focus on who you wish to become.==
- Your identity emerges out of your habits !!
	- Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously
	- edit your beliefs, and
	-  to upgrade and expand your identity.

The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

##### What And Why: Habit
- What is a Habit:
	- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.
		- Habit have become your identity
- Why we have Habit: 
	- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.


#### The 1st Law: Make It Obvious
1. Fill out the Habits Scorecard. 
	1. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.
2. Use implementation intentions: 
	1. “I will [BEHAVIOR] 
	2. at [TIME] 
	3. in [LOCATION].”
3. Use habit stacking:
	1. “After [CURRENT HABIT], 
	2. I will [NEW HABIT].”
4. Design your environment. 
	1. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.

Cue trigger the brain to initiate a behavior that will give a reward (for the primary part of the  brain, survival). 
Because cue is the 1st indication for a reward it lead to carving.


#### The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive
1. Use temptation bundling. 
	1. Pair :
		1. an action you want to do 
		2. with an action you need to do.
2. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
3. Create a motivation ritual. 
	1. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.

Carving is the motivation force behind every habit. 
One crave for the change, then the habit delivers. 

Cue are meangless unless it is interpreted. It is the feeling, though and emotions that transform the cue to a **craving**.


#### The 3rd Law: Make It Easy
1. Reduce friction. 
	1. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.
2. Prime the environment. 
	1. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.
3. Master the decisive moment. 
	1. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.
4. Use the Two-Minute Rule. 
	1. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.
5. Automate your habits. 
	1. Invest in technology
	2. And onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.

The respond is the actual habit you perform, can be though or action. 

#### The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying
1. Use reinforcement. 
	1. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.
2. Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. 
	1. IF avoiding a bad habit, 
		1. THEN design a way to see the benefits.
3. Use a habit tracker. 
	1. Keep track of your habit streak 
	2. and “don’t break the chain.”
4. Never miss twice.
	1. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.

Reward are the end goal of the habit. We chase reward cause
1. They satisfy us (dopamine rush, feeling good, etc ...)
2. They teach us what to remember
