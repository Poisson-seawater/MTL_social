# Loi 42 : Éliminer l’agitateur
###### intro
Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individualthe stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with themthey are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.

###### Corps
> Comprendre qui contrôle la dynamique du groupe est crucial dans le jeu du pouvoir. 

Souvent, un problème est lié à un seul fauteur de troubles (ex: *un arrogant sous-fifre promu empêcheur de tourner en rond*). Si vous lui laissez les moyens de nuire, les autres succomberont à son influence.
Donc, n’attendez pas que les problèmes créés par un élément récalcitrant se multiplient et n’essayez pas de négocier avec lui : il est incorrigible. 

Neutralisez son influence en l’isolant ou en l’excluant. Puis simplement le démasquer et le désigner aux autres.
- Décapitez la bande et vous en reprendrez le contrôle.

Within any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single source,
- the unhappy, 
- chronically dissatisfied one 
They will always stir up dissension and infect the group with his or her ill ease. 
Before you know what hit you the dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes impossible to disentangle one strand of misery from anodier, or to see how the whole thing started. 
First, recognize troublemakers by their overbearing presence, or by their complaining nature. Once you spot them do not try to reform them or appease them- that will only make things worse. Do not attack them, whether directly or indirecdy, for they are poisonous in nature and will work underground to destroy you. 
Do as the Adienians did: Banish them before it is too late. Separate them from the group before they become the eye of a whirlpool. Do not give them time to stir up anxieties and sow discontent; do not give them room to move. 
Let one person suffer so that the rest can live in peace.


Do not waste your time lashing out in all directions at what seems to be a many-headed enemy. Find the one head that matters - the person with willpower, or smarts, or, most important of all, charisma.
Whatever it costs you, lure this person away, for once he is absent his powers will lose their effect. His isolation can be 
- physical (banishment or absence from the court), 
- political (narrowing his base of support), or 
- psychological (alienating him from the group through slander and insinuation). 

-> Cancer begins with a single cell; excise it before it spreads beyond cure.


In the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of ministers. Only the elite had any power to play witii. Over the centuries, power has gradually become more and more diffused and democratized. 
This has created, however, a common misperception that groups no longer have centers of powerthat power is spread out and scattered among many people. Actually, however, power has changed in its numbers but not in its essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants commanding the power of life and death over millions, but there remain thousands of petty tyrants ruling smaller realms, and enforcing their will through indirect power games, charisma, and so on.
In every group, power is concentrated in the hands of one or two people, for this is one area in which human nature will never change: People will congregate around a single strong personality like planets orbiting a sun.
-> Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical realization.


Remember: Stirrers dirive by hiding in the group, disguising their actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible and they lose their power to upset.

A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy's power. In chess you try to corner the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to isolate the enemy's forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and ineffectual.
It is often better to isolate your enemies than to destroy them - you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the game of power, isolation spells death. The most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your victims from their power base.


Lesson from the absence of the cours: First, your absence from the court spells danger for you, and you should never leave the scene in a time of turmoil, for your absence can both symbolize and induce a loss of power; second, and on the other hand, luring your enemies away from the court at critical moments is a great ploy.

Isolation has other strategic uses. When trying to seduce people, it is often wise to isolate them from their usual social context. Once isolated they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes magnified. Isolation, can prove a powerful way of bringing people under your spell to seduce or swindle them.

You will often find powerful people who have alienated themselves from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their heads, and they consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost the knack of communicating with ordinary folk. 
Remember: This makes them vulnerable. Powerful though they be, people like this can be turned to use.



The Rasputin strategy can bring you great power: Always search out people who hold high positions yet who find themselves isolated on the board. They are like apples falling into your lap, easily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself.

Finally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an action will dishearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When Hernando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the Aztec and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on several fronts, nor were they intimidated by the numbers arrayed against them; they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Aim at the leaders, bring them down, and look for the endless opportunities in the confusion that will ensue.




###### Image: A Flock of Fatted Sheep. 
Do not waste precious time trying to steal a sheep or two; do not risk life and limb by setting upon the dogs that guard the flock. Aim at the shepherd. Lure him away and the dogs will follow. 
Strike him down and the flock will scatter you can pick them off one by one.

###### Authority: 
If you draw a bow, draw the strongest. If you use an arrow, use the longest. To shoot a rider, first shoot his horse. To catch a gang of bandits, first capture its leader. Just as a country has its border, so the killing of men has its limits. If the enemy's attack can be stopped [with a blow to the head], why have any more dead and wounded than necessary (Chinese poet Tu Fu, Tang dynasty, eighth century)

###### Reversal:
“Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way mat you need not fear his revenge,” writes Machiavelli. If you act to isolate your enemy, make sure he lacks the means to repay the favor. If you apply this Law, in other words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have nothing to fear from his resentment.

Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's successor as U.S. president, saw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his government. So he isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the great general, however, who responded by forming a support base in the Republican party and going on to become the next president. It would have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them close, you can secretly whit-tie away at their support base, so that when the time comes to cut them loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them.
