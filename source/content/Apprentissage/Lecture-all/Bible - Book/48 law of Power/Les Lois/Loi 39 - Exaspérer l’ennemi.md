#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 
###### intro
Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.

###### Corps
> Gardez votre calme en toute circonstance, a fortiori si votre adversaire sort de ses gonds.

Celui qui est capable de toujours garder son calme et rester objectif acquiert un pouvoir considérable. Pour déstabiliser un adversaire, trouvez en lui la faille qui le fera sortir de ses gonds.
Puis il suffit de le mettre en colère tout en conservant son sang froid.
- Si l’on peut mettre son ennemi en colère tout en conservant son sang-froid,
	- Alors on prend sur lui un avantage décisif. 

Le fait de rester calme en toute circonstance est un avantage décisif. Il faut toujours garder son calme et rester objectif.
La colère est stratégiquement contre-productive. 

Remember: Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They only create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your weakness, these stormy eruptions often herald a fall.


###### Haile Selassie
Haile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if he let Ras Gugsa decide the time and place of the revolt, the danger would be much greater than if he forced Gugsa to act on Selassie's terms. 
So he goaded him into rebellion by offending his manly pride, asking him to fight people he had no quarrel with on behalf of a man he hated. Thinking everything out ahead, Selassie made sure that Gugsa's rebellion would come to nothing, and mat he could use it to do away with his last two enemies.

This is the essence of the Law: 
When the waters are still, your opponents have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate and control. 
So stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to act before they are ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is to play on uncontrollable emotionspride, vanity, love, hate. Once the water is stirred up, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The angrier they become, the less control they have, and finally they are caught in the whirlpool you have made, and they drown.

A sovereign should never launch an army out of anger, a leader should never start a war out of wrath.
Sun-tzu, fourth century B. c.

Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seriously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They are so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take personally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify power. The truth is the opposite: Petulance is not power, it is a sign of helplessness. People may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, but in the end they lose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a person with so little self-control.
The answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional responses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange behavior. Instead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that nothing in the social realm, and in the game of power, is personal.
This shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more clarity and energy. Instead of overreacting, and becoming ensnared in people's emotions, you will turn their loss of control to your advantage: You keep your head while they are losing theirs.



###### Japaneses Tea Ceremony Lecon
The yoto Shoshidai Itakuea Suwo-no-kami had the habit of being too harh when listening to people asking for his jugement. 
So, he start grounding tea while listening to people. This way, by looking at the tea falling he could know his state of mind. 
If tea went unevenly, he would know he is not calm -> not rational and justice not impartiate. 

###### Arthur Schopenhauer
If possible, no animosity should be felt for anyone.... To speak angrily to a person, to show your hatred by what you say or by the way you look, is an unnecessary proceedingdangerous, foolish, ridiculous, and vulgar.

Anger or hatred should never be shown otherwise than in what you do; and feelings will be all the more effective in action, in so far as you avoid the exhibition of them in any other way. It is only the coldblooded animals whose bite is poisonous.

###### Image: The Pond of Fish. 
The waters are clear and calm, and the fish are well below the surface. Stir the waters and they emerge. Stir it some more and they get angry, rising to the surface, biting whatever comes near-including a freshly baited hook.

###### Authority: 
If your opponent is of a hot temper, try to irritate him. If he is arrogant, try to encourage his egotism. . . . One who is skilled at making the enemy move does so by creating a situation according to which the enemy will act; he entices the enemy with something he is certain to take. He keeps the enemy on the move by holding out bait and then attacks him with picked troops. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.)

###### Reversal:
When playing with people's emotions you have to be careful. Study the

enemy beforehand: Some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond.

The leaders of the city of Tyre, capital of ancient Phoenicia, felt confident they could withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the Orient but had not attacked their city, which stood well protected on the water. They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they would recognize him as emperor they would not allow him or his forces to enter Tyre. This of course enraged him, and he immediately mounted a siege. For four months the city withstood him, and finally he decided that the struggle was not worth it, and that he would come to terms with the Tyrians. But they, feeling that they had already baited Alexander and gotten away with it, and confident that they could withstand him, refused to

negotiatein fact diey killed his messengers.

This pushed Alexander over die edge. Now it did not matter to him how long the siege lasted or how large an army it needed; he had die resources, and would do whatever it took. He remounted his assault so strenuously mat he captured Tyre witiiin days, burned it to the ground, and sold its people into slavery.

You can bait the powerful and get mem to commit and divide their forces as Sun Pin did, but test die waters first. Find die gap in tiieir strengm. If mere is no gapif diey are impossibly strongyou have nodiing to gain and everydiing to lose by provoking diem. Choose carefully whom you bait, and never stir up die sharks.

Finally mere are times when a well-timed burst of anger can do you good, but your anger must be manufactured and under your control. Then you can determine exacdy how and on whom it will fall. Never stir up reactions mat will work against you in the long run. And use your tiiunder-bolts rarely, to make diem die more intimidating and meaningful. Whedier purposefully staged or not, if your outbursts come too often, they will lose Uieir power.
