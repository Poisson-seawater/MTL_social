#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actionsyour power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.

###### Corps
> L’une des clés du pouvoir réside dans la capacité à se modeler et être maître de son image.

Soyez maître de votre image, ne laissez pas les autres la définir pour vous. Posez publiquement des actes spectaculaires : votre pouvoir en sera rehaussé et votre personnalité prendra de la stature.


N’incarnez pas les clichés que la société vous impose. Forgez-vous une nouvelle identité qui exige l’attention et n’ennuie jamais l’auditoire.

Faites-en sorte que votre personnalité attire les faveurs de votre entourage. Apprendre de nombreux rôles pour incarner celui qu’il faut au moment voulu. Car, en sachant s’accommoder à toute sorte de gens, on gagne tous les cœurs. 
Comme le dit le dicton, qui se ressemble s’assemble. 

Faites-en sorte que votre personnalité attire les faveurs de votre entourage.

###### Julius Caesar
Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital link between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive interest in drama. He sublimated this interest by making himself an actor and director on the world stage. 
He said his lines as if they had been scripted; he gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of how he appeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his repertoire, building drama into his speeches, staging into his public appearances. His gestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp them instantiy. He became immensely popular.

Caesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like him, you must learn to enlarge your actions through dramatic techniques such as 
- surprise,
- suspense, 
- the creation of sympathy, 
- and symbolic identification. 

Also like him, you must be constantly aware of
- your audience; 
- what will please them and
- what will bore them. 

You must arrange to place yourself at the center, to command attention, and never to be upstaged at any cost.

###### Careful of
Understand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And once you accept that role you are doomed. 
Your power is limited to the tiny amount allotted to the role you have selected or have been forced to assume. 
An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that protean power, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity, one of your own making, one that has had no boundaries assigned to it by an envious and resentful world. 

This act of defiance is Promethean: It makes you responsible
for your own creation.

###### new identity 
Your new identity will protect you from the world precisely because it is not “you”; it is a costume you put on and take off. 
You need not take it personally. 
And your new identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical presence. 

Those in the back rows can see you and hear you. Those in the front rows marvel at your audacity.

Do not people talk in society of a man being a great actor? They do not mean by that, that he feels, ==but that he excels in simulating, though he feels nothing.==
\ - Denis Diderot, 1713-1784

###### Self creation
The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you are; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, your parents, your friends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. 

The Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop allowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake yourself into a character of power. Working on yourself like clay should be one of your greatest and most pleasurable life tasks. It makes you in essence an artist an artist creating yourself.

In fact, the idea of self-creation comes from the world of art. For thousands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to shape their public image and determine their own identity.

> Creat your own image

he first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness being aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance and emotions. ==As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sincer==

The second step in the process of self-creation is a variation on the George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one that compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage.
This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had but would delight in electing.

Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting appearance, or a single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time it is an unfolding event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important elements in the rhythm of drama is suspense. 
Houdini for instance, could sometimes complete his escape acts in seconds but he drew them out to minutes, to make the audience sweat.

BONUS: Besides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and deceive your enemy. 

Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment requires. Adapt your mask to the situationbe protean in the faces you wear. 
Bismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a liberal, to a hawk he was a hawk. He could not be grasped, and what cannot be grasped cannot be consumed.

###### Image: The Greek Sea-God Proteus.
His power came from his ability to change shape at will, to be whatever the moment required. When Menelaus, brother of Agamemnon, tried to seize him, Proteus transformed himself into a lion, then a serpent, a panther, a boar, running water, and finally a leafy tree.

###### Authority: 
Know how to be all things to all men. A discreet Proteusa scholar among scholars, a saint among saints. That is the art of winning over everyone, for like attracts like. Take note of temperaments and adapt yourself to that of each person you meetfollow the lead of the serious and jovial in turn, changing your mood discreedy. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal
There can really be no reversal to this critical law: Bad theater is bad theater. Even appearing natural requires artin other words, acting. Bad acting only creates embarrassment. Of course you should not be too dramaticavoid the histrionic gesture. But that is simply bad theater anyway, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against overacting. In essence there is no reversal to this law.
