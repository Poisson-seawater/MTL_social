-> [[Audace]]
###### intro
If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timithty is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.

###### Corps
Si vous n’êtes pas sur de l’issue d’une action, ne vous y lancez pas. Vos doutes et vos hésitations entraveraient son exécution. 
- La timithté est dangereuse : mieux vaut faire preuve d’audace.

Pour rectifier les erreurs commises à cause d’un manque de courage, il faut faire preuve d’encore plus de courage.

Les erreurs commises par audace sont facilement rectifiées grâce à plus d’audace encore. Tout le monde admire l’audacieux ; personne n’honore le timoré -> faire preuve de bravoure. 


###### Pourquoi "Bluffez"
La crédulité est bien souvent proportionnelle au degré de supercherie.

#### BOLDNESS AND HESITATION: A Brief Psychological Comparison 
Boldness and hesitation elicit very different psychological responses in their targets:
- Hesitation puts obstacles in your path, 
- boldness eliminates them. 

Once you understand this, you will find it essential to overcome your natural timidity and practice the art of audacity. The following are among the most pronounced psychological effects of boldness and timidity.

###### The Bolder the Lie the Better.
We all have weaknesses, and our efforts are never perfect. But entering action with boldness has the magical effect of hiting our deficiencies. 
Con artists know that the bolder the lie, the more convincing it becomes. The sheer audacity of the story makes it more credible, distracting attention from its inconsistencies. When putting together a con or entering any kind of negotiation, go further than you planned. Ask for the moon and you will be surprised how often you get it.

###### Lions Circle the Hesitant Prey.
People have a sixth sense for the weaknesses of others. If, in a first encounter, you demonstrate your willingness to compromise, back down, and retreat, you bring out the lion even in people who are not necessarily bloodthirsty. 

Everything depends on perception, and once you are seen as the kind of person who quickly goes on the defensive, who is willing to negotiate and be amenable, you will be pushed around without mercy.

###### Boldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority.
The bold move makes you seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes suddenly, with the stealth and swiftness of a snake, it inspires that much more fear. By intimidating with a bold move, you establish a precedent: in every subsequent encounter, people will be on the defensive, in terror of your next strike.

###### Going Halfway with Half a Heart digs the Deeper Grave. 
If you enter an action with less than total confidence, you set up obstacles in your own path. When a problem arises you will grow confused, seeing options where there are none and inadvertendy creating more problems still. Retreating from the hunter, the timid hare scurries more easily into his snares.

###### Hesitation Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them. 
When you take time to think, to hem and haw, you create a gap that allows others time to think as well. 
Your timifity infects people with awkward energy, elicits embarrassment. Doubt springs up on all sides.

Boldness destroys such gaps. The swiftness of the move and the energy of the action leave others no space to doubt and worry. In seduction, hesitation is fatal - it makes your victim conscious of your intentions.
The bold move crowns seduction with triumph: It leaves no time for reflection.

###### Audacity Separates You from the Herd
Boldness gives you presence and makes you seem larger than life. 
The timid fade into the wallpaper, the bold draw attention, and what draws attention draws power. 
We cannot keep our eyes off the audacious - we cannot wait to see their next bold move.

## Suite
Asking for more puts the other person on the defensive, cuts out the nibbling effect of compromise and doubt, and overwhelms with its boldness.

The Aretino strategy is simple: When you are as small and obscure as David was, you must find a Goliath to attack. 
The larger the target, the more attention you gain. 
The bolder the attack, the more you stand out from the crowd, and the more admiration you earn. 

Society is full of those who think daring thoughts but lack the guts to print and publicize them. Voice what the public feels - the expression of shared feelings is always powerful. Search out the most prominent target possible and sling your boldest shot. The world will enjoy the spectacle, and will honor the underdog - you, that is with glory and power.

Most of us are timid. We want to avoid tension and conflict and we want to be liked by all. We may contemplate a bold action but we rarely bring it to life. We are terrified of the consequences, of what others might think of us, of the hostility we will stir up if we dare go beyond our usual place.
Although we may disguise our timidity as a concern for others, a desire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the opposite: we are really self-absorbed, worried about ourselves and how others perceive us. 
Boldness, on the other hand, is outer-directed, and often makes people feel more at ease, since it is less selfconscious and less repressed.
-> This can be seen most clearly in seduction.

All great seducers succeed through effrontery. Casanova's boldness was not revealed in a daring approach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to flatter her; it consisted in his ability to surrender himself to her completely and to make her believe he would do anything for her, even risk his life, which in fact he sometimes did. The woman on whom he lavished this attention understood that he held nothing back from her. This was infinitely more flattering than compliments. At no point during the seduction would he show hesitation or doubt, simply because he never felt it


You must practice and develop your boldness. You will often find uses for it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of negotiation, particularly those discussions in which you are asked to set your own price.

###### Image: The Lion and the Hare. 
The lion creates no gaps in his wayhis movements are too swift, his jaws too quick and powerful. The timid hare will do anything to escape danger, but in its haste to retreat and flee, it backs into traps, hops smack into its enemies' jaws.

###### Authority: 
I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than cautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to master her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets herself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed coldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to the young, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master her with greater audacity. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

###### Reversal
Boldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions. It is a tactical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and think ahead, and make the final element the bold move that will bring you success. In other words, since boldness is a learned response, it is also one that you learn to control and utilize at will. To go through life armed only with audacity would be tiring and also fatal. You would offend too many people, as is proven by those who cannot control their boldness. One such person was Lola Montez; her audacity brought her triumphs and led to her seduction of the king of Bavaria. But since she could never rein in her boldness, it also led to her downfallin Bavaria, in England, wherever she turned. It crossed the border between boldness and the appearance of cruelty, even insanity. Ivan the Terrible suffered the same fate: When the power of boldness brought him success, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a lifelong pattern of violence and sathsm. He lost the ability to tell when boldness was appropriate and when it was not.

Timithty has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit, however, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is no longer timithty but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in with your show of shyness, all the better to pounce on mem boldly later.
