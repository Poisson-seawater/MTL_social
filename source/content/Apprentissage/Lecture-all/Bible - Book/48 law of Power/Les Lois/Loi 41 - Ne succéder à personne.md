#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making: Establish your own name and identity by changing course. Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way.

###### Corp
Le premier arrivé paraît toujours plus éclatant et plus original que celui qui prend sa suite. 
Celui qui succède à un grand homme doit fournir plus d’effort pour s’extraire de l’ombre de son prédécesseur et s'en éclipser. 
- Ne vous perdez pas dans son ombre ; ne vous identifiez pas à un passé qui n’est pas le vôtre. 

Lorsqu’on prend la relève, il convient donc
- d’affirmer son nom et  identité en changeant radicalement de trajectoire.
- Tuez le père dominateur, jetez son legs aux orties et établissez votre pouvoir en brillant à votre façon.

As Machiavelli states, necessity is what impels men to take action, and once the necessity is gone, only rot and decay are left. Having no need to increase his store of power, Louis XV inevitably succumbed to inertia. 
Under him, Versailles, the symbol of the Sun King's authority, became a pleasure palace of incomparable banality, a kind of Las Vegas of the Bourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that the oppressed peasantry of France hated about their king, and during the Revolution they looted it with glee.

Power depends on appearing larger than other people, and when you are lost in die shadow of the father, the king, the great predecessor, you cannot possibly project such a presence.

> But when they began to make sovereignty hereditary, the children quickly degenerated from their fathers; and, so far from trying to equal their father's virtues, they considered that a prince had nothing else to do than to excel all the rest in idleness, indulgence, and every other variety of pleasure.
> Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527

The son will never step out of his father's shadow unless he adopts the ruthless strategy of Alexander: disparage the past, create your own kingdom, put the father in the shadows instead of letting him do the same to you. 
If you cannot materially start from ground zero - it would be foolish to renounce an inheritance - you can at least begin from ground zero psychologically, by throwing off the weight of the past and charting a new direction. 
Alexander instinctively recognized that privileges of birth are impediments to power. 
> Be merciless with the past, then - not only widi your father and his father but with your own earlier achievements. 

Only the weak rest on their laurels and dote on past triumphs; in the game of power there is never time to rest.
-> word is constantly changing !!


The distance you establish from your predecessor often demands some symbolism, a way of advertising itself publicly. Louis XIV, for example, created such symbolism when he rejected the traditional palace of the French kings and built his own palace of Versailles. 
He would not be a king like his fadier or earlier ancestors, he would not wear a crown or carry a scepter or sit on a throne, he would establish a new kind of imposing authority with symbols and rituals of its own. Louis made his ancestors' rituals into laughable relics of the past.
Follow his example: Never let yourself be seen as following your predecessor's path. If you do you will never surpass him. ==You must physically demonstrate your difference, by establishing a style and symbolism that sets you apart.==

There is a kind of stubborn stupidity that recurs throughout history, and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief that if the person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can re-create their success by doing the same thing. 
This cookie-cutter approach will seduce the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their timidity and their laziness. But circumstances never repeat themselves exactly.

Finally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and prosperity tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is secure we have no need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for those who achieve success and power at an early age. 

It is not necessary to go to the extremes of burning all past achievement (your and other), but you must be prepared to return to square one psychologically rather than growing fat and lazy with prosperity. 
How often our early triumphs turn us into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful people recognize these traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re-create themselves. The father must not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every step of the way.
-> just like the [[Ego is the enemy - note|ego]].


###### Innovez
Votre prédécesseur était particulièrement apprécié ? Alors inutile de chercher à l’imiter. Au petit jeu de la comparaison, vous sortiriez perdant. 

###### Image: The Father. 
He casts a giant shadow over his children, keeping them in thrall long after he is gone by tying them to the past, squashing their youthful spirit, and forcing them down the same tired path he followed himself. His tricks are many. At every crossroads you must slay the father and step out of his shadow.

###### Authority: 
Beware of stepping into a great man's shoesyou will have to accomplish twice as much to surpass him. Those who follow are taken for imitators. No matter how much they sweat, they will never shed that burden. It is an uncommon skill to find a new path for excellence, a modern route to celebrity. There are many roads to singularity, not all of them well traveled. The newest ones can be arduous, but they are often shortcuts to greatness. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal:
The shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is chosen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power. Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-uncle Napoleon Bonaparte to help him become first president and then emperor of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not stay tied to the past; he quickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep the public from expecting him to attain the heights that Bonaparte had attained.

The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander the Great recognized and was influenced by his father's skill in organizing an army. Making a display of doing things differently from your predecessor can make you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your actions have a logic of their own.

Joseph II, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a show of doing the exact opposite of his motherdressing like an ordinary citizen, staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the “people's emperor.” Maria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal and aristocratic. The problem was that she had also been beloved, an empress who ruled wisely

after years of learning the hard way. If you have the kind of intelligence and instinct mat will point you in the right direction, playing the rebel will not be dangerous. But if you are mediocre, as Joseph II was in comparison to his mother, you are better off learning from your predecessor's knowledge and experience, which are based on something real.

Finally, it is often wise to keep an eye on the young, your future rivals in power. Just as you try to rid yourself of your father, they will soon play the same trick on you, denigrating everything you have accomplished. Just as you rise by rebelling against the past, keep an eye on those rising from below, and never give them the chance to do die same to you.

The great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bernini was a master at sniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping mem in his shadow. One day a young stonemason named Francesco Borromini showed Bernini his architectural sketches. Recognizing his talent immediately, Bernini in-standy hired Borromini as his assistant, which delighted the young man but was actually only a tactic to keep him close at hand, so that he could play psychological games on him and create in him a kind of inferiority complex. And indeed, despite Borromini's brilliance, Bernini has the greater fame. His strategy with Borromini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing mat the great sculptor Alessandro Algardi, for example, would eclipse him in fame, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant. And any assistant who rebelled against Bernini and tried to strike out on his own would find his career ruined.
