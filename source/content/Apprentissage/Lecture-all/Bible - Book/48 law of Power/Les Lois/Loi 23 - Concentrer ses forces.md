#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at theirstrongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to anotherintensity defeats ex-tensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come.

###### Corps
> Fixez-vous un seul objectif et mettez toute votre énergie à l’atteindre.

L’auteur constate que le pouvoir est toujours concentré. Dans toutes organisations, c’est généralement un petit groupe qui tient les rênes. La source du pouvoir ne réside pas dans la quantité mais dans la qualité. Ainsi, mieux vaut concentrer ses forces et ne pas les disperser. “L’intensif l’emporte toujours sur l’extensif”.


Économisez vos forces et votre énergie en les gardant concentrées à leur niveau le plus élevé : on gagne plus en exploitant un filon riche et profond qu’en faisant de l’orpaillage : l’intensif l’emporte toujours sur l’extensif. Quand on recherche des sources de pouvoir pour s’élever, il faut se trouver un maître de poids, une laitière bien grasse qui donnera du lait longtemps.


The best strategy is always to be very strong; first in general, then at the decisive point. . . . There is no higher and simpler law of strategy than that of keeping one's forces concentrated. . . . In short the first principle is: act with the utmost concentration.
\ - On War, Carl von Clausewitz, 1780 - 1831


###### Image:  The Arrow. 
You cannot hit two targets with one arrow. If your thoughts stray, you miss the enemy's heart. Mind and arrow must become one. Only with such concentration of mental and physical power can your arrow hit the target and pierce the heart.

###### Authority: 
Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection resides in quality, not quantity. Extent alone never rises above mediocrity, and it is die misfortune of men with wide general interests that while they would like to have their finger in every pie, they have one in none. Intensity gives eminence, and rises to the heroic in matters sublime. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal
There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao Tse-tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts, using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suitable for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla warfare. When fighting a stronger army, concentrating your forces only makes you an easier targetbetter to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your enemy with the elusiveness of your presence.

Tying yourself to a single source of power has one preeminent danger: If that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suffer. This is what happened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and wars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison),

Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the years, and was now wimout his father's protection. In cases when you may need protection, then, it is often wise to entwine yourself around several sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of great tumult and violent change, or when your enemies are numerous. The more patrons and masters you serve the less risk you  run if one of them falls from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off against die other. Even if you concentrate on die single source of power, you still must practice caution, and j repare for the day when your master or patron is no longer there to help you.

Finally, being too single-minded in purpose can make you an intolerable bore, especially in die arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was so obsessed widi perspective diat his paintings look lifeless and contrived. Whereas Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everythingarchitecture, painting, warfare, sculpture, mechanics. Diffusion was the source of his power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on the side of intensity.
