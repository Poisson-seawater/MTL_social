###### intro
When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.

###### Corps
> Plus vous en dites et plus vous risquez de dire des bêtises.

-> histoire de Coriolanus, général et héro Romain.

Il convient donc de maîtriser ses paroles car une fois les mots sortis, il sera trop tard. 
- Les personnages puissants impressionnent et intimident parce qu’ils sont peu loquaces.
- A l’inverse, plus on parle, 
	- plus on a l’air banal et plus on a de risques de dire des bêtises.
	- plus on semble indécis, avec de la difficulté a exprimé une idée, non certain de ses paroles ou pire manipulateur


Plus les parole sont rare, plus elles sembleront originales même si elles sont anodine. Les meilleurs paroles restent vagues et énigmatiques (comme une fable, donc courte). 


Léonard de Vinci, 1452-1519 : _« Les huitres béent quand la lune est pleine ; et quand le crabe en aperçoit une, il y projette un caillou ou une algue en sorte que l’huitre ne puisse plus se refermer : son repas est servi. Tel est le sort de celui qui ouvre trop grand la bouche et se met ainsi à la merci de son auditeur. »_
-> Le Corbeau et le Renard, de La Fontaine.

Power is in many ways a game of appearances, and when you say less than necessary, you inevitably appear greater and more powerful than you are. Your silence will make other people uncomfortable. Humans are machines of interpretation and explanation; they have to know what you are thinking. When you carefully control what you reveal, they cannot pierce your intentions or your meaning.
-> Your short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments that will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses. They will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and they will go home and ponder your every word. This extra attention to your brief comments will only add to your power

Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be outweighed by the price you pay.

###### Pourquoi "parler peu"
Plus vous vous exprimez, plus vous vous exposez.

> It is even more damaging for a minister to say foolish things than to do them.
> \- Cardinal de Retz, 1613-1679


###### Image: Oracle of Delphi
When visitors consulted the Oracle, the priestess would utter a few enigmatic words that seemed full of meaning and import. No one disobeyed the words of the Oracle they held power over life and death.

###### Authority:
Never start moving your own lips and teeth before the subordinates do. The longer I keep quiet, the sooner others move their lips and teeth. As they move their lips and teeth, I can thereby understand tiieir real intentions.... If the sovereign is not mysterious, the ministers will find opportunity to take and take. 
(Han-fei-tzu, Chinese philosopher, third century B.C.)


###### Reversal:
There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or ambiguous comment can open you up to interpretations you had not bargained for. Silence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with caution, then, and in the right situations. It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester, who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks and entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a fool.

Also, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any deception you might practice. By bending your listener's ear with talk, you can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspicious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and manipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the reverse of the silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking more, and making yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can practice deception with greater ease.
