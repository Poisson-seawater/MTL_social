#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.

###### Corps
> Ne laissez rien au hasard : anticipez tous les coups jusqu’à la victoire.


Le pouvoir appartient à ceux qui ont la capacité d’ignorer les dangers et de différer le plaisir en ayant une vision long terme. 
Tout est dans le dénouement. Prévoyez toutes les étapes qui y mènent en tenant compte de leurs éventuelles conséquences, des obstacles qui risquent de surgir et des revers de fortune qui pourraient anéantir vos efforts.

En planifiant votre action jusqu’au bout, 
- vous ne serez pas pris au dépourvu et 
- vous saurez quand vous arrêter. 

Guidez la chance avec doigté et mettez-la de votre côté en faisant preuve d’une vision à long terme.

==So much of power is not what you do but what you do not do== - the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from before they get you into trouble. 
Plan in detail before you act - do not let vague plans lead you into trouble. 


When you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to improvise. 
Your clarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are the primary reasons why so many fail to conclude their actions successfully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation.


There is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve victory they only hunger for more. To stopto aim for a goal and then keep to itseems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the maintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs creates a reaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods on Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all tilings.
###### Image: The Gods on Mount Olympus.
Looking down on human actions from the clouds, they see in advance the endings of all the great dreams that lead to disaster and tragedy. And they laugh at our inability to see beyond the moment, and at how we delude ourselves.

###### Authority: 
How much easier it is never to get in than to get yourself out! We should act contrary to the reed which, when it first appears, throws up a long straight stem but afterwards, as though it were exhausted . . . makes several dense knots, indicating that it no longer has its original vigor and drive. We must rather begin gendy and coolly, saving our breath for the encounter and our vigorous thrusts for finishing off the job. In their beginnings it is we who guide affairs and hold them in our power; but so often once they are set in motion, it is they which guide us and sweep us along. (Montaigne, 1533-1592)

###### Reversal
It is a cliche among strategists that your plan must include alternatives and have a degree of flexibility. That is certainly true. If you are locked into a plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with sudden shifts of fortune. Once you have examined the future possibilities and decided on your target, you must build in alternatives and be open to new routes toward your goal.

Most people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity than from vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the face of circumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating a reversal to this Law, then, for no good can come from refusing to think far into the future and planning to the end. If you are clear- and far-thinking enough, you will understand that the future is uncertain, and that you must be open to adaptation. Only having a clear objective and a far-reaching plan allows you that freedom.
