# Loi 24 : Être un courtisan modèle

- [ ] aggrandire mes notes ici !!
###### intro
The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court.

###### Corps
> Inspirez-vous des courtisans, du passé et d’aujourd’hui

Le courtisan évolue dans un monde où tout tourne autour du pouvoir et du jeu politique. Il doit maîtriser l’art du flou, flatter, s’abaisser devant les grands et exercer son pouvoir sur les autres de manière aussi courtoise que discrète. Apprenez et appliquez les lois de la cour, et votre ascension ne connaîtra pas de limites.
Un douzaine des principes sur lesquels s’appuient le jeu de la cours, du pouvoir et de la politique :
- Éviter l’ostentation
- Pratiquer la nonchalance
- Flatter avec parcimonie
- S’arranger pour être remarqué
- Moduler son style et son langage en fonction de son interlocuteur
- Ne pas être le messager des mauvaises nouvelles
- Ne pas faire preuve de familiarité déplacée avec son maître
- Ne jamais critiquer ses supérieurs directs
- Demander rarement des faveurs à ses supérieurs
- Ne jamais plaisanter ni sur le physique ou le goût de quiconque
- Ne pas être systématiquement cynique
- Savoir se juger
- Garder son sang froid
- Etre dans l’air du temps
- Être source de plaisir

In court, honesty is a fool's game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe that the master is interested in your criticisms of him, no matter how accurate they are.


It is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to be rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and wilful incivility, is just as insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire. For politeness is like a counteran avowedly false coin, with which it is foolish to be stingy. A sensible man will be generous in the use of it.... Wax, a substance naturally hard and brittle, can be made soft by the application of a little warmth, so that it will take any shape you please. In the same way, by being polite and friendly, you can make people pliable and obliging, even though they are apt to be crabbed and malevolent. Hence politeness is to human nature what warmth is to wax.
\- Arthur Schopenhauer, 1788-1860



### THE LAWS OF COURT POLITICS

###### Avoid Ostentation. 
It is never prudent to prattle on about yourself or call too much attention to your actions. The more you talk about your deeds the more suspicion you cause. You also stir up enough envy among your peers to induce treachery and backstabbing. Be careful, ever so careful, in trumpeting your own achievements, and always talk less about yourself than about other people. Modesty is generally preferable.

###### Practice Nonchalance.
Never seem to be working too hard. Your talent must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people take you for a genius rather than a workaholic. Even when something demands a lot of sweat, make it look effortlesspeople prefer to not see your blood and toil, which is another form of ostentation. It is better for them to marvel at how gracefully you have achieved your accomplishment than to wonder why it took so much work.


###### Be Frugal with Flattery.
It may seem that your superiors cannot get enough flattery, but too much of even a good thing loses its value. It also stirs up suspicion among your peers. Learn to flatter indirectlyby downplaying your own contribution, for example, to make your master look better.

###### Arrange to Be Noticed. 
There is a paradox: You cannot display yourself too brazenly, yet you must also get yourself noticed. In the court of Louis XIV, whoever the king decided to look at rose instandy in the court hierarchy. You stand no chance of rising if the ruler does not notice you in the swamp of courtiers. This task requires much art. It is often initially a matter of being seen, in the literal sense. Pay attention to your physical appearance, then, and find a way to create a distinctivea subtly distinctivestyle and image.

###### Alter Your Style and Language According to the Person You Are Dealing With. 
The pseudo-belief in equalitydie idea that talking and acting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes you somehow a paragon of civilizationis a terrible mistake. Those below you will take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and those above you will be offended, although they may not admit it. You must change your style and your way of speaking to suit each person. 

This is not lying, it is acting, and acting is an art, not a gift from God. Learn the art. This is also true for the great variety of cultures found in the modern court: 
- Never assume that your criteria of behavior and judgment are universal. 

Not only is an inability to adapt to another culture the height of barbarism, it puts you at a disadvantage.

##### Never Be the Bearer of Bad News. 
The king kills the messenger who brings bad news: This is a cliche but there is truth to it. 
You must struggle and if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the bearer of bad news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good news and your approach will gladden your master.


###### Never Affect Friendliness and Intimacy with Your Master. 
He does not want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a subordinate. Never approach him in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best of termsthat is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this level, assume a wary chumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and make the distance between you clear.

###### Never Criticize Those Above You Directly. 
This may seem obvious, but there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessaryto say nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks of another sort. You must learn, however, to couch your advice and criticism as indirectly and as politely as possible. Think twice, or three times, before deciding you have made them sufficiently circuitous. Err on the side of subtlety and gentieness.

###### Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. 
Nothing irritates a master more than having to reject someone's request. It stirs up guilt and resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop. Rather than making yourself the supplicant, it is always better to earn your favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask for favors on another person's behalf, least of all a friend's.

###### Never Joke About Appearances or Taste.
A lively wit and a humorous disposition are essential qualities for a good courtier, and there are times when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those above you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig your own grave.

###### Do Not Be the Court Cynic. 
Express admiration for the good work of others. If you constandy criticize your equals or subordinates some of that criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever you go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will irritate them. By expressing modest admiration for other people's achievements, you paradoxically call attention to your own. The ability to express wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying talent, but one still greatiy valued.

###### Be Self-observant 
The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mirror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling you what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: You must be the mirror, training your mind to try to see yourself as others see you.
Are you acting too obsequious 
Are you trying too hard to please
Do you seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the decline 

> Be observant about yourself and you will avoid a mountain of blunders.

###### Master Your Emotions.
As an actor in a great play, you must learn to cry and laugh on command and when it is appropriate. You must be able both to disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your contentment and agreement. You must be the master of your own face. Call it lying if you like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to always be honest and upfront, do not complain when others call you obnoxious and arrogant.

###### Fit the Spirit of the Times. 
A slight affectation of a past era can be charming, as long as you choose a period at least twenty years back; wearing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role of court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times, even if the times offend your sensibilities. Be too forward-thinking, however, and no one will understand you. It is never a good idea to stand out too much in this area; you are best off at least being able to mimic the spirit of the times.

###### Be a Source of Pleasure. 
This is critical. It is an obvious law of human nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful, while charm and the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself the flame and you will rise to the top. Since life is otherwise so full of unpleasantness and pleasure so scarce, you will be as indispensable as food and drink. This may seem obvious, but what is obvious is often ignored or unappreciated. There are degrees to this: Not everyone can play the role of favorite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit. But we can all control our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessary.


###### Quote
A man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes and of his face; he is profound, impenetrable; he dissimulates bad offices, smiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disguises his passions, belies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings.
Jean de La Bruyere, 1645 - 1696


## suite
Never imagine that skill and talent are all mat matter. In court the courtier's art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time on your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of all is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around him.

It is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in one stroke takes die genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are common in the life of a courtier: By giving attention to one master, he displeases anotfier. You must find a way to navigate mis Scylla and Charybdis safely. Masters must receive tiieir due; never inadvertendy stir up the resentment of one in pleasing another.

In matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your master. Taste is one of die ego's prickliest parts; never impugn or question the master's tastehis poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable, and his manner the model for all.


Do not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to the best of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing more you are doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to seem to be trying too hardit is as if you were covering up some deficiency. Fulfilling a task that has not been asked of you just makes people suspicious. If you are a crown-keeper, be a crown-keeper. Save your excess energy for when you are not in the court.


Never ask for too much, then, and know when to stop. It is the master's prerogative to give - to give when he wants and what he wants, and to do so without prompting. 
Do not give him the chance to reject your requests. Better to win favors by deserving them, so that they are bestowed without your asking.

Many of a courtier's anxieties have to do with the master, with whom most dangers lie. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that the master is the only one to determine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play integral parts also. A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and powerful envy. You have to placate everyone who might someday harm you, deflecting their resentment and envy and diverting their hostility onto other people.


It is always beneficial to play the obliging courtier, even when you are not serving a master. -> [ignore pettyness]


###### Conclusion:
courtiership is a subde art, and overlooked traps and inadvertent mistakes can ruin your best tricks. Never risk being caught in your maneuvers; never let people see your devices. If that happens you instandy pass in people's perceptions from a courtier of great manners to a loamsome rogue. 
It is a delicate game you play; apply the utmost attention to covering your tracks, and never let your master unmask you.
