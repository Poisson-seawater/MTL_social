# Loi 36 : Disdain Things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best Revenge
###### intro
By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.

###### Corps
Prêter attention à un ennemi le renforce. Si ce que vous désirez est hors de votre portée, traitez-le par le mépris. Moins vous vous montrerez intéressé, plus vous paraîtrez supérieur.

En prêtant attention à un problème insignifiant, on le renforce et on lui donne de l’importance. Il convient donc de ne montrer aucun intérêt pour les diverses contrariétés. Les réponses les plus efficaces aux broutilles sans importance sont le mépris et le dédain. 
À vouloir réparer une erreur minuscule, on risque de l’aggraver. -> Loi sur la parole !!


You choose to let things bother you. You can just as easily choose not to notice the irritating offender, to consider the matter trivial and unworthy of your interest. That is the powerful move. What you do not react to cannot drag you down in a futile engagement. Your pride is not involved. The best lesson you can teach an irritating gnat is to consign it to oblivion by ignoring it. If it is impossible to ignore (Pancho Villa had in fact killed American citizens), then conspire in secret to do away with it, but never inadvertently draw attention to the bothersome insect that will go away or die on its own. If you waste time and energy in such entanglements, it is your own fault. Learn to play the card of disdain and turn your back on what cannot harm you in the long run.

When you pay attention to a person, the two of you become partners of sorts, each moving in step to the actions and reactions of the other. In the process you lose your initiative. It is a dynamic of all interactions: By acknowledging other people, even if only to fight with them, you open yourself to their influence. 
By ignoring people you cancel them out. This unset-ties and infuriates them - but since they have no dealings with you, there is nothing they can do.

This is the offensive aspect of the law. Playing the card of contempt is immensely powerful, for it lets you determine the conditions of the conflict. The war is waged on your terms. This is the ultimate power pose: You are the king, and you ignore what offends you. 
Watch how this tactic infuriates people - half of what they do is to get your attention, and when you with hold it from them, they flounder in frustration.

> MAN: Kick himhe'll forgive you. Flatter himhe may or may not see through you. But ignore him and he'll hate you.
> \- Idries Shah, Caravan of Dreams, 1968

Desire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want something, the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you show, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your interest is too strongit makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic.


If choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the opposite approach - commitment and engagement - often weakens you. By paying undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer it takes you to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems. 

A second danger: If you succeed in crushing the irritant, or even if you merely wound it, you create sympathy for the weaker side. Critics of Franklin D. Roosevelt complained bitterly about the money his administration spent on government projects, but their attacks had no resonance with the public, who saw the president as working to end the Great Depression. His opponents thought they had an example that would show just how wasteful he had become: his dog, Fala, which he lavished with favors and attention. Critics railed at his insensitivity spending taxpayers' money on a dog while so many Americans were still in poverty. But Roosevelt had a response: How dare his critics attack a defenseless little dog.

It is tempting to want to fix our mistakes, but the harder we try, the worse we often make them. It is sometimes more politic to leave them alone.
Instead of inadvertendy focusing attention on a problem, making it seem worse by publicizing how much concern and anxiety it is causing you, it is often far wiser to play the contemptuous aristocrat, not deigning to acknowledge the problem's existence. There are several ways to execute this strategy:

First there is the sour-grapes approach. If there is something you want but that you realize you cannot have, the worst thing you can do is draw attention to your disappointment by complaining about it. An infinitely more powerful tactic is to act as if it never really interested you in the first place. 

Second, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people's attention by making it clear that the attack has not even registered. Look away, or answer sweetly, showing how litde the attack concerns you. Similarly, when you yourself have committed a blunder, the best response is often to make less of your mistake by treating it lightly.

Among equals this tactic might backfire: Your indifference could make you seem callous. 
But with a master, if you act quickly and without great fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry response, save him the time and energy he would waste by brooding over it, and allow him the opportunity to display his own lack of pettiness publicly.

Remember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something has affected you, or that you are offended - that only shows you have acknowledged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and without affectation.



###### Pourquoi "Ignorez les petites mesquineries"
Vous témoignerez ainsi de votre force de caractère.

###### Image: The Tiny Wound.
It is small but painful and irritating. You try all sorts of medicaments, you complain, you scratch and pick at the scab. Doctors only make it worse, transforming the tiny wound into a grave matter. If only you had left the wound alone, letting time heal it and freeing yourself of worry.

###### Authority: 
Know how to play the card of contempt. It is the most politic kind of revenge. For there are many of whom we should have known nothing if their distinguished opponents had taken no notice of them. There is no revenge like oblivion, for it is the entombment of the unworthy in the dust of their own nothingness. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal:
You must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most small troubles will vanish on their own if you leave diem be; but some will grow and fester unless you attend to them. Ignore a person of inferior stature and the next time you look he has become a serious rival, and your contempt has made him vengeful as well. The great princes of Renaissance Italy chose to ignore Cesare Borgia at the outset of his career as a young general in the army of his father, Pope Alexander VI. By the time they paid attention it was too latedie cub was now a lion, gobbling up chunks of Italy. Often, tlien, while you show contempt publicly you will also need to keep an eye on the problem privately, monitoring its status and making sure it goes away. Do not let it become a cancerous cell.

Develop the skill of sensing problems when they are still small and taking care of them before they become intractable. Learn to distinguish between the potentially disastrous and the mildly irritating, the nuisance that will quietiy go away on its own. In eidier case, though, never completely take your eye off it. As long as it is alive it can smolder and spark into life.
