#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
Be wary of friendsthey will betray you more quickly, for they
are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and
tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal
than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no
enemies, find a way to make them.

###### Corps
> To have a good enemy, choose a friend: He knows where to strike 
> \- Diane de Poitiers, 1499-1566, mistress of Henri II of France

On a plus à craindre de ses alliés que de ses adversaires. Un ancien ennemi sera plus loyal qu’un ami parce qu’il devra faire ses preuves. 
Afin de mettre un ennemi à son service, viser la satisfaction réciproque des intérêts personnels de chacun <-> économies des échanges (pas seulement monétaire !!).


En fait, vous avez plus à craindre de vos amis que de vos ennemis. Si vous n’avez pas d’ennemis, trouvez le moyen de vous en faire.

> Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies.
> \-Voltaire, 1694-1778

-> Michael III et Basilius de l'Empire Byzantain. 
-> General Chao K'uang-yin devenant l'Empreur Sung après son intronation rend ses allié noble, mais sans armé ni pouvoir politique. 


###### Niccolo Machiavelli,
There are many who think therefore that a wise prince ought, when he has the chance, to foment astutely some enmity, so that by suppressing it he will augment his greatness. Princes, and especially new ones, have found more faith and more usefulness in those men, whom at the beginning of their power they regarded with suspicion, than in those they at first confided in. Pandolfo Petrucci, prince of Siena, governed his state more by those whom he suspected than by others.


###### Pourquoi "ne recruter pas l’un de vos amis" ?
En son for intérieur, celui-ci se sentira redevable, ce qui peut mettre à mal son orgueil, nourrir son ressentiment et vous créer des ennuis.


###### Image: The Jaws of Ingratitude.
Knowing what would happen if you put a finger in the mouth of a lion, you would stay clear of it. 
With friends you will have no such caution, and if you hire them, they will  eat you alive with ingratitude. 
(Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

> Men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure. 
> \-Tacitus, c. a.d. 55-120


###### Authority
Know how to use enemies for your own profit. You must learn to grab a sword not by its blade, which would cut you, but by the handle, which allows you to defend yourself. The wise man profits more from his enemies, than a fool from his friends.
(Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)


###### Reversal
Although it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there are times when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the sake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for him; friends often do this the best, since their affection for him makes them willing to take chances. Also, if your plans go awry for some reason, you can use a friend as a convenient scapegoat. This “fall of the favorite” was a trick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their closest friend at court take the fall for a mistake, since the public would not believe that they would deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course, after you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to reserve the scapegoat role for someone who is close to you but not too close.

Finally, the problem about working with friends is that it confuses the boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be employed to great effect. You must never let your guard down in such a venture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of power, and even the closest of friends can be transformed into the worst of enemies
