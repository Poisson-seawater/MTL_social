#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once it slips, however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them.

> La réputation est la pierre angulaire du pouvoir.

Elle est une protection dans le jeu dangereux des apparences. À elle seule, elle peut vous permettre d’impressionner et de gagner; cependant, lorsqu’elle est compromise, vous êtes vulnérable et l’on vous attaquera de toutes parts.
- C’est pourquoi, il faut veiller à ce qu’elle soit toujours impeccable. 
- Soyez vigilant et déjouez les attaques avant qu’elles ne se produisent. 

Construire une réputation fondée sur de solides qualités (la générosité, l’honnêteté, l’humilité). 
En parallèle, il conseille aussi d’apprendre à détruire ses ennemis par leur réputation. Il suffit d’ouvrir une brèche, puis de se taire et laisser faire la meute.

*For, as Cicero says, even those who argue against fame still want the books they write against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become famous for despising it. Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our friends have our goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame and making someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be found* - Montaigne, 1533-1592.

Barnum used two different tactics to ruin Peale's reputation. The first was simple: He sowed doubts about the museum's stability and solvency. 
Doubt is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of die bag with insidious rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma.
On the one hand they can deny the rumors, even prove diat you have slandered diem. 
But a layer of suspicion will remain:
- Why are they defending themselves so desperately Maybe the rumor has some truth to it 
- If, on die otiier hand, they take the high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even stronger. 
- If done correctiy, the sowing of rumors can so infuriate and unsettle your rivals that in defending themself they will make numerous mistakes. 
- This is the perfect weapon for those who have no reputation of their own to work from.

Once Barnum did have a reputation of his own, he used the second, gender tactic, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridiculed his rivals' reputation. 
This too was extremely successful. Once you have a solid base of respect, ridiculing your opponent both puts him on the defensive and draws more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation. Outright slander and insult are too strong at this point; they are ugly, and may hurt you more than help you. 
But gentle barbs and mockery suggest that you have a strong enough sense of your own worth to enjoy a good laugh at your rival's expense. A humorous front can make you out as a harmless entertainer while poking holes in the reputation of your rival.

> It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation.
> \- Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900

Reputation has a power like magic: With one stroke of its hand, it can double your strength. It can also send people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear brilliant or dreadful, can depend entirely on the reputation of the doer.

###### Tactic
Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Especially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictiy, anticipating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemiestiiat reveals insecurity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and never appear desperate in your self-defense. On the other hand, an attack on another man's reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you have less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle, and your own thus-far-small reputation gives him a small target when he tries to return your fire. 

Barnum used such campaigns to great effect in his early career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem to engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy's reputation cleverly, you will inadvertentiy ruin your own.


##### HOW to
- [ ] link avec les autres fiches !!!
In the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one outstanding quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. 
This quality sets you apart and gets other people to talk about you. 
Then make your reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care to build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like wildfire.

##### SI mauvaise réputation
Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are prevented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate with someone whose image counteracts your own, using dieir good name to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputation for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. When P. T. Barnum wanted to clean up a reputation for promoting vulgar entertainment, he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a stellar, high-class reputation, and the American tour Barnum sponsored for her gready enhanced his own image.

##### Pourquoi "protéger sa RÉPUTATION"
Avec une image positive, tout est beaucoup plus facile; penser au "beauty priviledge".

Warren Buffet : « _Il faut vingt ans pour construire une réputation et cinq minutes pour la détruire_. » 

As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene, or utter a single word.

Your success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the suecess of Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy rested on his reputation for ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that Kissinger could not sway him. 
A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as soon as Kissinger's name became involved in the negotiations.

##### Authority: 
Therefore I should wish our courtier to bolster up his inherent worth with skill and cunning, and ensure that whenever he has to go where he is a stranger, he is preceded by a good reputation. . . . For the fame which appears to rest on the opinions of many fosters a certain unshakable belief in a man's worth which is then easily strengthened in minds already thus disposed and prepared. (Baldassare Castiglione, 1478-1529)

##### Reversal
There is no possible Reversal. Reputation is critical; there are no exceptions to this law. Perhaps, not caring what others think of you, you gain a reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a valuable image in itselfOscar Wilde used it to great advantage. Since we must live in society and must depend on the opinions of others, there is nothing to be gained by neglecting your reputation. By not caring how you are perceived, you let others decide this for you. Be the master of your fate, and also of your reputation.
