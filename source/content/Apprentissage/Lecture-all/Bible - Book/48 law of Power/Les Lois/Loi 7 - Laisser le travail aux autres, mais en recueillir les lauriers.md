#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you

###### Corps
> Ne faites jamais ce que les autres peuvent faire à votre place

Autrement dit, l’une des clés du pouvoir est d’utiliser la sagesse, le savoir et le travail des autres pour faire avancer sa propre cause. L’idée est de ne jamais faire ce que les autres peuvent faire à notre place. 

Ainsi il est précieux de s’entourer de collaborateurs qui ont la compétence et la créativité dont on manque. 
- À la fin, vos collaborateurs seront oubliés et on ne se souviendra que de vous. 

On peut corréler cette loi à la citation d’Isaac Newton : “monter sur les épaules des géants” (S’appuyer sur les exploits des autres pour ses propres découvertes).

Non seulement cette aide vous fera gagner une énergie et un temps précieux, mais elle vous conférera une aura quasi divine d’efficacité et de diligence. .


The world of power has the dynamics of the jungle: 
- There are those who live by hunting and killing, and there are also vast numbers of creatures (hyenas, vultures) who live off the hunting of others.
	- These latter, less imaginative types are often incapable of doing the work that is essential for the creation of power. 
	- They understand early on, though, mat if they wait the earth in search of long enough, they can always find another animal to do the work for them. 

Do not be naive: At this very moment, while you are slaving away on some project, there are vultures circling above trying to figure out a way to survive and even thrive off your creativity. It is useless to complain about this, it to the industrious or to wear yourself ragged with bitterness, as Tesla did. Better to protect yourself and join the game. 

Once you have established a power base, become a vulture yourself, and save yourself a lot of time and energy.

There is another application of this law that does not require the parasitic use of your contemporaries' labor: Use the past, a vast storehouse of knowledge and wisdom. 
Isaac Newton called this “standing on the shoulders of giants.” He meant that in making his discoveries he had built on the achievements of others. A great part of his aura of genius, he knew, was attributable to his shrewd ability to make the most of the insights of ancient, medieval, and Renaissance scientists. Shakespeare borrowed plots, characterizations, and even dialogue from Plutarch, among other writers, for he knew that nobody surpassed Plutarch in the writing of subde psychology and witty quotes. How many later writers have in their tarn borrowed from plagiarized Shakespeare

###### THE TORTOISE. THE ELEPHANT AND THE HIPPOPOTAMI'S

One day the tortoise met the elephant, who trumpeted, “Out of my way, you weakling or might step on you!” 

The tortoise was not afraid and stayed where he was, so the elephant stepped on him, but could not crush him. “Do not boast, Mr. Elephant, I am as strong as you are!” said the tortoise, but the elephant just laughed. 
So the tortoise asked him to come to his hill the next morning.

The next day, before sunrise, the tortoise ran down the hill to the river, where he met the hippopotamus, who was just on his way back into the water after his nocturnal feeding. “Mr Hippo! Shall we have a tug-of-war I bet I'm as strong as you are!” said the tortoise. The hippopotamus laughed at this ridiculous idea, but agreed. 
The tortoise produced a long rope and told the hippo to hold it in his mouth until the tortoise shouted “Hey!” Then the tortoise ran back up the hill where he found the elephant, who was getting impatient. He gave the elephant the other end of the rope and said, “When I say 'Hey!' pull, and you'll see which of us is the strongest.” Then he ran halfway back down the hill, to a place where he couldn be seen, and shouted, “Hey!” The elephant and the hippopotamus pulled and pulled, but neither could budge the otherthey were of equal strength. They both agreed that the tortoise was as strong as thev were. Never do what others can do for you. 
The tortoise let others do the work for him while he got the credit.

###### Pourquoi "Apprenez à déléguer tout en recueillant les fruits du travail réalisé"
Objectif: vous concentrer uniquement sur ce que les autres ne peuvent faire à votre place. 
- Vous pourrez ainsi démultiplier votre efficacité et votre rapidité. 

En outre, vous passerez excellent manager capable de motiver ses équipes jusqu’à la réussite du projet.
Et vous placerez ainsi vos concurrents en situation de réaction et finirez par les épuiser.
###### Image: The Vulture. 
Of all the creatures in the jungle, he has it the easiest. The hard work of others becomes his work; their failure to survive becomes his nourishment. Keep an eye on the Vulturewhile you are hard at work, he is circling above. Do not fight him, join him.

###### Authority: 
There is much to be known, life is short, and life is not life without knowledge. It is therefore an excellent device to acquire knowledge from everybody. Thus, by the sweat of another's brow, you win the reputation of being an oracle. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)


###### Reversal
There are times when taking the credit for work that others have done is not the wise course: If your power is not firmly enough established, you will seem to be pushing people out of the limelight. To be a brilliant exploiter of talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused of deception.

Be sure you know when letting other people share the credit serves your purpose. It is especially important to not be greedy when you have a master above you. President Richard Nixon's historic visit to the People's Republic of China was originally his idea, but it might never have come off but for the deft diplomacy of Henry Kissinger. Nor would it have been as successful without Kissinger's skills. Still, when the time came to take credit, Kissinger adroitiy let Nixon take die lion's share. Knowing that the truth would come out later, he was careful not to jeopardize his standing in the short term by hogging the limelight. Kissinger played the game expertly: He took credit for the work of those below him while graciously giving credit for his own labors to those above. That is the way to play the game.
