#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, afire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.

###### Corps
> Ne prenez pas le risque d’une demi-victoire. S’il n’est pas totalement anéanti, votre adversaire n’aura qu’une obsession : se venger.


On a beaucoup plus à perdre en faisant preuve de clémence qu’en éliminant entièrement son ennemi. 
- Écrasez-le, non seulement physiquement mais aussi en esprit.

Le but du pouvoir est de contrôler totalement ses adversaires, de les forcer à obéir. En leur laissant une alternative, ils risquent de chercher à se venger.  S’il subsiste ne serait-ce qu’une faible braise, un feu peut reprendre.


> simple: your enemi will wish you ill.

crushed beneadi your foot but left alive, will rear up and bite you with a double dose of venom. An enemy that is left around is like a half-dead viper that you nurse back to health. Time makes the venom grow stronger.

###### Authority: 
For it must be noted, that men must either be caressed or else annihilated; they will revenge themselves for small injuries, but cannot do so for great ones; the injury therefore that we do to a man must be such that we need not fear his vengeance. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

###### Reversal:

This law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that it is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such a thing is possible, than to make them suffer by your hand. In warfare, for example, a good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is cornered, its soldiers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes better, then, to leave them an escape route, a way out. As they retreat, they wear themselves out, and are ultimately more demoralized by the retreat than by any defeat he might inflict on the battlefield. When you have someone on the ropes, thenbut only when you are sure they have no chance of recoveryyou might let them hang themselves. Let them be the agents of their own destruction. The result will be the same, and you won't feel half as bad.

Finally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of Versailles had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that in the long run it would be better to show some leniency. The problem is, your leniency involves another riskit may embolden the enemy, which still harbors a grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is almost always wiser to crush your enemy. If tfiey plot revenge years later, do not let your guard down, but simply crush them again.
