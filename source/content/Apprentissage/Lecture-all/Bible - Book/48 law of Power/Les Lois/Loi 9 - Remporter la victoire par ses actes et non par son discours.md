###### intro
Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.

###### Corps

>  Votre pouvoir sera bien plus grand si vous arrivez à obtenir son accord par vos seules actions, sans dire un mot. Ne prêchez pas, montrez l’exemple.


Le triomphe momentané obtenu en haussant le ton n’est qu’une victoire à la Pyrrhus : 
- le ressentiment, la rancœur que l’on suscite sont plus forts et plus durables que la docilité forcée de votre interlocuteur.

Les actions sont beaucoup plus convaincantes et significatives que des paroles en l’air. Un pouvoir sera ainsi bien plus grand s’il s’obtient en faisant la preuve concrète de son idée. Car, personne ne discute la matérialité d’un fait. A ce sujet, l’auteur recommande d’apprendre à évaluer l’effet à long terme de ses actes.

Hausser la voix ne vous fera jamais triompher. Vous ne ferez qu’attiser le ressentiment de votre adversaire.

> Learn to demonstrate the correctness of your ideas indirectly.

Story of Micheal Angelo and David, his patron say something regarding the nose of the sculture, and instead of arguing. Micheal Angelo simply mimic working, ask his patron to come closer. Hence the patron didn't ended up offended and Micheal Angelo save his art -> double win. 

The power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not get defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making them literally and physically feel your meaning is infinitely more powerful than argument.

A heckler once interrupted Nikita Khrushchev in the middle of a speech in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. 
- “You were a colleague of Stalin's,” the heckler yelled, “why didn't you stop him then” 
- Khrushschev apparently could not see the heckler and barked out, “Who said that”
- No hand went up. No one moved a muscle.
- After a few seconds of tense silence, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, “Now you know why I didn't stop him.” 

The most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol. The power of a symbola flag, a mythic story, a monument to some emotional eventis that everyone understands you without anything being said.

When aiming for power, or trying to conserve it, always look for the indirect route. And also choose your batdes carefully. If it does not matter in the long run whemer the other person agrees with youor if time and their own experience will make them understand what you mean then it is best not even to bother with a demonstration. 
Save your energy and walk away.

###### Image: The Seesaw. 
Up and down and up and down go the arguers, getting nowhere fast. Get off the seesaw and show them your meaning without kick ing or pushing. Leave them at the top and let gravity bring them gently to the ground.

###### Authority: 
Never argue. In society nothing must be discussed; give only results. (Benjamin Disraeli, 1804-1881)



###### Reversal
Verbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To distract and cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are caught in a lie. In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all the conviction you can muster. Draw the other person into an argument to distract them from your deceptive move. When caught in a lie, the more emotional and certain you appear, the less likely it seems that you are lying.

This technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once Count Victor Lustig, swindler par excellence, had sold dozens of suckers around the country a phony box with which he claimed to be able to copy money. Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally chose not to go the police, rather than risk the embarrassment of publicity. But one Sheriff Richards, of Remsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being conned out of $ 10,000, and one morning he tracked Lustig down to a hotel in Chicago.

Lustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was looking down the barrel of a gun. “What seems to be the problem” he calmly asked. “You son of a bitch,” yelled the sheriff, “I'm going to kill you. You conned me with that damn box of yours!” Lustig feigned confusion. “You mean it's not working” he asked. “You know it's not working,” replied the sheriff. “But that's impossible,” said Lustig. “There's no way it couldn't be working. Did you operate it properly” “I did exactly what you told me to do,” said the sheriff. “No, you must have done something wrong,” said Lustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel of the gun was gently lowered.

Lustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the box's operation, completely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and argued less forcefully. “Look,” said Lustig, “I'll give you your money back right now. I'll also give you written instructions on how to work the machine and I'll come out to Oklahoma to make sure it's working properly. There's no way you can lose on that.” The sheriff reluctandy agreed. To satisfy him totally, Lustig took out a hundred one-hundred-dollar bills and gave diem to him, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago. Calmer and a littie confused, the sheriff

Calmer and a littie confused, the sheriff finally left. Over die next few days Lustig checked the paper every morning. He finally found what he was looking for: A short article reporting Sheriff Richards's arrest, trial, and conviction for passing counterfeit notes. Lustig had won the argument; the sheriff never bodiered him again.
