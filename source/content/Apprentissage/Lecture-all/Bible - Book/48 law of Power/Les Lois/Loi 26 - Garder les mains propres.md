#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats and cat's-paws to disguise your involvement.

###### Corps
Il convient de devenir un parangon de probité et de civisme. Autrement dit, il s’agit de devenir un modèle dont les actes sont dignes d’être imités.  Il faut donc ne s’abaisser à aucune gaffe ni magouille et rester au-dessus de tout soupçon
Restez au-dessus de tout soupçon. Utilisez plutôt les autres comme des boucs émissaires ou chargez-les de tirer à votre place les marrons du feu. De plus, il sera le fusible idéal lorsque le danger se rapprochera.


## PART I: CONCEAL YOUR MISTAKES-HAVE A SCAPEGOAT AROUND TO TAKE THE BLAME
Our good name and reputation depend more on what we conceal than on what we reveal. Everyone makes mistakes, but those who are truly clever manage to hide them, and to make sure someone else is blamed. A convenient scapegoat should always be kept around for such moments.

The Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and useless beings at the public expense; and when any calamity, such as plague, drought, or famine, befell the city . . . [these scapegoats] were led about. . . and then sacrificed, apparently by being stoned outside the city.
The Golden Bough, Sir James George Frazer, 1854-1941

Besides conveniently shifting blame, a scapegoat can serve as a warning to others.
-> Exemple of Cardinal de Richelieu who execute one of the brother of one of his enemis (cause this enemi was impossible to attack).

In fact it is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible as a sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and their naive protests may be seen as protesting too muchmay be seen, in other words, as a sign of their guilt. 
Be careful, however, not to create a martyr. It is important that you remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed by the incompetence of those around you. 
If the scapegoat appears too weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your own device. Sometimes you should find a more powerful scapegoatone who will elicit less sympatiry in the long run.

ALSO:  history has time and again shown the value of using a close associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the “fall of the favorite.” The public would readily believe in the scapegoat's guiltwhy would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were guilty And the other courtiers, resentful of the favorite anyway, would rejoice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid himself of a man who by that time had probably learned too much about him, perhaps becoming arrogant and even disdainful of him

###### On mystake
Occasional mistakes are inevitablethe world is just too unpredictable. 
People of power, however, are undone not by the mistakes they make, but by the way they deal with them. Like surgeons, they must cut away the tumor with speed and finality. Excuses and apologies are much too blunt tools for this delicate operation; the powerful avoid them. 
- By apologizing you open up all sorts of doubts about your competence, your intentions, any other mistakes you may not have confessed. 

Excuses satisfy no one and apologies make everyone uncomfortable. The mistake does not vanish with an apology; it deepens and festers. Better to cut it off instantly, distract attention from yourself, and focus attention on a convenient scapegoat before people have time to ponder your responsibility or your possible incompetence.

> I would rather betray the whole world than let the world betray me.
> General Ts'ao Ts'ao, c. A.D. 155-220

###### Sacrifice of Other
It is an extremely human response to not look inward after a mistake or crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a convenient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside himself and his own sin of incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. 
This profound need to exteriorize one's guilt, to project it on another person or object, has an immense power, which the clever know how to harness. Sacrifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a well-spring of power. 

###### B. Franklin
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness. 
Throughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being the nice guy would have spelled political disasteryet he could not be seen as the agent of any foul play. 
For twenty years, then, his secretary, Louis Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handled the backroom deals, the manipulation of the press, the underhanded campaign maneuvers. And whenever a mistake was committed, or a dirty trick contradicting Roosevelt's carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the scapegoat, and never complained.


###### Image: The Innocent Goat.
On the Day of Atonement, the high priest brings the goat into the temple, places his hands on its head, and confesses die people's sins, transferring guilt to the guiltless beast, which is then led to the wilderness and abandoned, the people's sins

and blame vanishing with him.

###### Authority: 
Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being incapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise conceal die blunders they have made, while fools make them public. Reputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is seen. If you can't be good, be careful. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

## PART II: MAKE USE OF THE CAT'S-PAW 
In the fable, the Monkey grabs the paw of his friend, the Cat, and uses it to fish chestnuts out of the fire, thus getting the nuts he craves, without hurting himself.

If there is something unpleasant or unpopular that needs to be done, it is far too risky for you to do the work yourself. You need a cat's-paw someone who does the dirty, dangerous work for you. The cat's-paw grabs what you need, hurts whom you need hurt, and keeps people from noticing that you are the one responsible. Let someone else be the executioner, or the bearer of bad news, while you bring only joy and glad tidings.

A queen must never dirty her hands with ugly tasks, nor can a king appear in public with blood on his face. Yet power cannot survive without the constant squashing of enemiesthere will always be dirty little tasks that have to be done to keep you on the throne. Like Cleopatra, you need a cat's-paw.

###### Choosing cat - pawn
This will usually be a person from outside your immediate circle, who will therefore be unlikely to realize how he or she is being used. You will find these dupes everywherepeople who enjoy doing you favors, especially if you throw them a minimal bone or two in exchange. But as they accomplish tasks that may seem to them innocent enough, or at least completely justified, they are actually clearing the field for you, spreading the information you feed them, undermining people they do not realize are your rivals, inadvertently furthering your cause, dirtying dieir hands while yours remain spotless.

There are two uses of the cat's-paw: 
1. to save appearances, as Cleopatra did, 
2. and to save energy and effort. 

The latter case in particular demands that you plan several moves in advance, realizing that a temporary move backward (letting Chiang go, say) can lead to a giant leap forward. 
If you are temporarily weakened and need time to recover, it will often serve you well to use those around you both as a screen to hide your intentions and as a cat's-paw to do your work for you. Look for a powerful third party who shares an enemy with you (if for different reasons), then take advantage of their superior power to deal blows which would have cost you much more energy, since you are weaker.
You can even gently guide them into hostilities. Always search out the overly aggressive as potential cat's-paws they are often more than willing to get into a fight, and you can choose just the right fight for your purposes.

###### For Friend or Courtship, be the Cat's-Paw (for non [reputation] threath)

Daizen's example provides the paradigm for every favor done between friends and peers: never impose your favors. Search out ways to make yourself the cat's-paw, indirectly extricating your friends from distress without imposing yourself or making them feel obligated to you.

> One should not be too straightforward. Go and see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.
> \- Kautilya, Indian philosopher, third century B.C.


Finally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering yourself as the cat's-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the perfect courtier. 
Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who once placed his own cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen Elizabeth would not sully her shoes. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasantness or danger, you gain immense respect, which sooner or later will pay dividends. And remember: If you can make your assistance subde and gracious rather than boastful and burdensome, your recompense will be that much the more satisfying and powerful.

###### Conclusion
As a leader you may imagine that constant diligence, and the appearance of working harder than anyone else, signify power. Actually, though, they have the opposite effect: They imply weakness. Why are you working so hard Perhaps you are incompetent, and have to put in extra effort just to keep up; perhaps you are one of those people who does not know how to delegate, and has to meddle in everything. The truly powerful, on the other hand, seem never to be in a hurry or overburdened. While others work their fingers to the bone, they take their leisure. They know how to find the right people to put in the effort while they save their energy and keep their hands out of the fire. Similarly, you may believe that by taking on the dirty work yourself, involving yourself directly in unpleasant actions, you impose your power and instill fear. In fact you make yourself look ugly, and abusive of your high position.
Truly powerful people keep their hands clean. Only good things surround them, and the only announcements they make are of glorious achievements.

###### Cat Pawn to get people to you or to people
Use an associate or subordinate to hook you up with your primary target. The cat's-paw establishes your credibility and shields you from the unsavory appearance of being too pushy in your courtship.
The easiest and most effective way to use a cat's-paw is often to plant information with him that he will then spread to your primary target. False or planted information is a powerful tool, especially if spread by a dupe whom no one suspects. You will find it very easy to play innocent and disguise yourself as the source.

-> Exemple of a therapist who, for couple therapy, would accept to just see the one in the couple who want therapy. Then say think that would make the 2nd one's furious. So both (the whole couple) would come.

###### Image: The Cat's-Paw.
It has long claws to grab things. It is soft and padded. Take hold of the cat and use its paw to pluck things out of the fire, to claw your enemy, to play with the mouse before devouring it.
Sometimes you hurt the cat, but most often it doesn't feel a thing.

###### Authority:
Do everything pleasant yourself, everything unpleasant through third parties. By adopting the first course you win favor, by taking the second you deflect ill will. Important affairs often require rewards and punishments. Let only the good come from you and the evil from others. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal
The cat's-paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme caution and delicacy. They are like screens that hide your own involvement in dirty work from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are seen as the manipulator, the puppet master, the whole dynamic turns aroundyour hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be blamed for misfortunes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is revealed, events will snowball beyond your control.

If you have to use a cat's-paw or a scapegoat in an action of great consequence, be very careful: Too much can go wrong. It is often wiser to use such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations will cause no serious harm.

Finally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not disguise your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself for some mistake. If you have power and are secure in it, you should sometimes play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of his own sacrifices for die good of die people. Similarly, upon occasion you may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and trembling in your subordinates. Instead of the cat's-paw you show your own mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If you play it too often, fear will turn into resentment and hatred. Before you know it, such emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday bring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat's-pawit is far safer.
