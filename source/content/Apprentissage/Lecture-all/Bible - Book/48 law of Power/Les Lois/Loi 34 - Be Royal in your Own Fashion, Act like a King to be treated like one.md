#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.

###### Corps
Le traitement qu’on vous réserve est le reflet de votre attitude : la vulgarité, la banalité n’inspire nul respect.

C’est parce qu’un roi se respecte qu’il inspire le respect aux autres. Montrez vous royal et confiant dans votre pouvoir, et vous apparaîtrez digne de porter la couronne.

Le fait de se respecter et d’avoir confiance en son pouvoir sont des leviers pour améliorer l’estime que nous portent les autres. Quelques principes:
- Avoir des exigences audacieuses
- S’entourer d’appuis puissants
- Faire des cadeaux à ses supérieurs


Powerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura, trying to create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basically die same. But the people whom ths false gesture is intended to impress will quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more powerthat it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person's fate. The only kind of common touch that works is the kind affected by Franklin Roosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the common people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never pretended to erase his distance from the crowd.

Columbus was a bad crew leader and navigator. 
BUT at one area he was a genius: He knew how to sell himself. How else to explain how the son of a cheese vendor, a low-level sea merchant, managed to ingratiate himself with the highest royal and aristocratic families

Columbus had an amazing power to charm the nobility, and it all came from the way he carried himself. He projected a sense of confidence mat was completely out of proportion to his means. Nor was his confidence the aggressive, ugly self-promotion of an upstartit was a quiet and calm self-assurance. In fact it was the same confidence usually shown by the nobility themselves. The powerful in the old-style aristocracies felt no need to prove or assert themselves; being noble, they knew they always deserved more, and asked for it. With Columbus, then, they felt an instant affinity, for he carried himself just the way they did - elevated above the crowd, destined for greatness.

Understand: It is within your power to set your own price. How you carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for little, shuffle your feet and lower your head, people will assume this reflects your character. But this behavior is not you - it is only how you have chosen to present yourself to other people. You can just as easily present the Columbus front: buoyancy, confidence, and the feeling that you were born to wear a crown.

> With all great deceivers there is a noteworthy occurrence to which they owe their power. In the actual act of deception they are overcome by belief in themselves: it is this which then speaks so miraculously and compellingly to those around them.
> \- Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900

###### The Strategy of the Crown
The Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause and effect: 
- If we believe we are destined for great things, our belief will radiate outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king. 

This outward radiance will infect the people around us, who will think we must have reasons to feel so confident. People who wear crowns seem to feel no inner sense of the limits to what they can ask for or what they can accomplish. This too radiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear.
Use the Strategy of the Crown and you will be surprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an example those happy children who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their high expectations are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishes just as Isabella enjoyed granting the wishes of Columbus.

The trick is simple: Be overcome by your self-belief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of deception on yourself, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one.

You have to act differently, demonstrating your distance from those around you. One way to emphasize your difference is to always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance.


###### recap
Finally, to reinforce the inner psychological tricks involved in projecting a royal demeanor, there are outward strategies to help you create the effect. 
First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your price high and do not waver. 
Second, in a dignified way, go after the highest person in the building. 

This immediately puts you on the same plane as the chief executive you are attacking. 

It is the David and Goliath Strategy: By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of greatness.


Third, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that you can take. When the Renaissance writer Retro Aretino wanted the Duke of Mantua as his next patron, he knew that if he was slavish and sycophantic, the duke would think him unworthy; so he approached the duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the writer's good friend Titian.
Accepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his own aristocratic stamp. He funded Aretino generously. The gift strategy is subde and brilliant because you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified way mat implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens to have more money.

Remember: It is up to you to set your own price. Ask for less and that is just what you will get. Ask for more, however, and you send a signal that you are worth a king's ransom. Even those who turn you down respect you for your confidence, and mat respect will eventually pay off in ways you cannot imagine.


###### Baltasar Gracian
Never lose your self-respect, nor be too familiar with yourself when you are alone. Let your integrity itself be your own standard of rectitude, and be more indebted to the severity of your own judgment of yourself than to all external precepts. Desist from unseemly conduct, rather out of respect for your own virtue than for the strictures of external authority. Come to hold yourself in awe, and you will have no need of Seneca's imaginary tutor.

Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658

###### Image: Image: The Crown. 
Place it upon your head and you assume a different posetranquil yet radiating assurance. Never show doubt, never lose your dignity beneath the crown, or it will not fit. It will seem to be destined for one more worthy. Do not wait for a coronation; the greatest emperors crown themselves.


###### Authority: 
Everyone should be royal after his own fashion. Let all your actions, even though they are not those of a king, be, in their own sphere, worthy of one. Be sublime in your deeds, lofty in your thoughts; and in all your doings show that you deserve to be a king even though you are not one in reality. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal:
The idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set yourself apart from omer people, but if you take this too far it will be your undoing. Never make die mistake of thinking diat you elevate yourself by humiliating people. Also, it is never a good idea to loom too high above the crowdyou make an easy target. And mere are times when an aristocratic pose is eminently dangerous.

Charles I, king of England during the 1640s, faced a profound public disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts erupted throughout the country, led by Oliver Cromwell. Had Charles reacted to the times with insight, supporting reforms and making a show of sacrificing some of his power, history might have been different. Instead he reverted to an even more regal pose, seeming outraged by the assault on his power and on the divine institution of monarchy. His stiff kingliness offended people and spurred on their revolts. And eventually Charles lost his head, literally. Understand: You are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain.

Finally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through affecting a kind of earmy vulgarity, which will prove amusing by its extremeness. But to the extent that you win this game by going beyond the limits, separating yourself from other people by appearing even more vulgar than diey are, the game is dangerous: There will always be people more vulgar than you, and you will easily be replaced the following season by someone younger and worse.
