###### intro
The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfi-dence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.

###### Corps
Le moment de la victoire est celui du plus grand péril. Dans l’euphorie de la réussite, un excès de confiance en vous peut vous pousser à dépasser le but que vous vous étiez fixé.
- L’euphorie de la victoire peut altérer votre jugement. 
- **Mythe d’Icare**: tout à son plaisir de voler, le fils de Dédale en oublie son but premier et se rapproche dangereusement du soleil. 
	- ainsi: la fonte de ses ailes le précipite dans la mer qui l’engloutit.

Or, en allant au-delà du but que l’on s’est fixé, on prend le risque de 
- s’exposer à des situations non anticipées 
-  de tomber dans l’inconnu.
- de ce faire plus d’ennemis que vous n’en avez vaincus

Ne laissez pas le succès vous monter à la tête. Rien ne remplace une bonne stratégie et une planification prudente. 
- Fixez-vous un but, et lorsque vous l’aurez atteint, arrêtez-vous.
	- et sa veux dire que c'est l'heure de la nouvelle génération
	- "You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain…" 
		- (die or just quit)


Understand: In the realm of power, you must be guided by reason. To let a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide your moves will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be cautious. When you gain victory, understand the part played by the particular circumstances of a situation, and never simply repeat the same actions again and again. History is littered with the ruins of victorious empires and die corpses of leaders who could not learn to stop and consolidate their gains.

>Mistake are always mde when people get to the easy places. 

Like Madame de Pompadour, you need to realize that your moment of triumph is also a moment when you have to rely on cunning and strategy all the more, consolidating your power base, recognizing the role of luck and circumstance in your success, and remaining vigilant against changes in your good fortune. It is the moment of victory when you need to play the courtier's game and pay more attention than ever to the laws of power.

###### Key to power
Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping people off balance while they set the tempo. 
The essence of strategy is controlling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to control what comes next in two ways.
First, you owe your success to a pattern that you are apt to try to repeat. You will try to keep moving in the same direction without stopping to see whether this is still the direction that is best for you. 
Second, success tends to go to your head and make you emotional. Feeling invulnerable, you make aggressive moves diat ultimately undo the victory you have gained.

The lesson is simple: The powerful vary their rhythms and patterns, change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise. Rather than letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look where they are going. It is as if their bloodstream bore a kind of antidote to the intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to a kind of mental halt when they have attained success. They steady them-selves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened, examine the role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in riding school, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control the horse.

Luck and circumstance always play a role in power. This is inevitable, and actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may think, good luck is more dangerous than bad luck. Bad luck teaches valuable lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you mink your brillliance will carry you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn, and when it does you will be completely unprepared.

According to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to have good luck: He had a pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck for real - his father's death - he was unprepared for it, and the many enemies he had made devoured him. The good luck that elevates you or seals your success brings the moment for you to open your eyes: The wheel of fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. ==If you prepare for the fall, it is less likely to ruin you when it happens.==

When you are victorious, then, lie low, and lull the enemy into inaction. These changes of rhythm are immensely powerful.

When you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, letting him get die glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to establish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust.
-> [[Loi 1 - Ne jamais surpasser le maître]]

Another moment when a small success can spoil the chances for a larger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a dangerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecure - perhaps you feel you did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you can when you have the chance, which may not come again. The proper response is to accept the favor graciously and withdraw. Any subsequent favors you should earn without having to ask for them.

Finally, the moment when you stop has great dramatic import. What comes last sticks in the mind as a kind of exclamation point. There is no better time to stop and walk away than after a victory. Keep going and you risk lessening the effect, even ending up defeated. As lawyers say of cross-examination, “Always stop with a victory.”


###### the art of cross-examination, Francis L. Wellman, 1913
In all your cross-examinations .... most important of all, let me repeal the injunction to be ever on the alert for a good place to stop. Nothing can be more important than to cU)se your examination with a triumph. So many lawyers succeed in catching a witness in a serious contradiction; but, not satisfied with this, go on asking questions, and taper off their examination until the effect upon the jury of their former advantage is lost altogether.

###### Image: Icarus Falling from the Sky.
His father Daedalus fashions wings of wax that allow the two men to fly out of the labyrinth and escape the Minotaur. Elated by the triumphant escape and the feeling of flight, Icarus soars higher and higher, until the sun melts the wings and he hurtles to his death.

###### Authority: 
Princes and republics should content themselves with victory, for when they aim at more, they generally lose. The use of insulting language toward an enemy arises from the insolence of victory, or from the false hope of victory, which latter misleads men as often in their actions as in their words; for when this false hope takes possession of the mind, it makes men go beyond the mark, and causes them to sacrifice a certain good for an uncertain better. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

###### Reversal:
As Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave him alone entirely. Inflicting half punishment or mild injury will only create an enemy whose bitterness will grow with time, and who will take revenge. When you beat an enemy, then, make your victory complete. Crush him into nonexistence. In the moment of victory, you do not restrain yourself from crushing the enemy you have defeated, but rather from needlessly advancing against others. Be merciless with your enemy, but do not create new enemies by overreaching.

There are some who become more cautious than ever after a victory, which they see as just giving them more possessions to worry about and protect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose momentum, but rather act as a safeguard against rash action. On the other hand, momentum as a phenomenon is gready overrated. You create your own successes, and if they follow one upon the otiier, it is your own doing. Belief in momentum will only make you emotional, less prone to act strategically, and more apt to repeat the same memods. Leave momentum for those who have nothing better to rely upon.
