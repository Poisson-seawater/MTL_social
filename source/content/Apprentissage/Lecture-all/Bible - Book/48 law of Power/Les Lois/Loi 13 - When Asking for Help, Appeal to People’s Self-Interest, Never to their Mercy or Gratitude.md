#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself.

###### Corps
 > La fidélité repose sur un intérêt personnel à collaborer avec vous

A chaque étape sur le chemin du pouvoir, il faut s’entraîner à se mettre à la place de l’autre, à déchiffrer ses besoins et ses intérêts. 

SI vous avez besoin d’un allié, 
ALORS ne lui rappelez pas l’aide que vous lui avez apportée ni les services que vous lui avez rendus, vous le feriez fuir.


Pour convertir quelqu’un en allié,
- il vaut mieux insister sur ce qu’il a à gagner, 
	- Plus il aura à y gagner, plus il fera preuve d’empressement.
- plutôt que de lui rappeler l’aide qu’on lui a apportée ou les services qu’on lui a rendus.
- **personne n'aime être redevable et la gratitude se perd vite !!!**


Most men are so thoroughly subjective that nothing really interests them but themselves. They always think of their own case as soon as ever any remark is made, and their whole attention is engrossed and absorbed by the merest chance reference to anything which affects them personally, be it never so remote. 
\- Arthur Schopenhauer, 1788-1860 

-> Histoire de Corcyra et Corinth. 

When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past. As die Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fact pragmaticthey will rarely act against their own self-interest.

In your quest for power, you will constantiy find yourself in the position of asking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to asking for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs.
Do not appeal for the greater good, appeal for one-self interest. 


Japan and Holland were vasdy different cultures, but each shared a timeless and universal concern: self-interest. Every person you deal with is like anotiier culture, an alien land with a past tiiat has nothing to do witii yours. Yet you can bypass die differences between you and him by appealing to his self-interest. Do not be subde: You have valuable knowledge to share, you will fill his coffers with gold, you will make him live longer and happier. This is a language mat all of us speak and understand.
A key step in die process is to understand die other person's psychology. Is he vain Is he concerned about his reputation or his social standing Does he have enemies you could help him vanquish Is he simply motivated by money and power
-> Exemple of Genghis Khan et Ch'u-Ts'ai qui sauve la Chine.

###### Image: A Cord that Binds. 
The cord of mercy and gratitude is threadbare, and will break at the first shock. Do not throw such a lifeline. The cord of mutual self-interest is woven of many fibers and cannot easily be severed. It will serve you well for years.


###### Authority: 
The shortest and best way to make your fortune is to let people see clearly that it is in their interests to promote yours. (Jean de La Bruyere, 1645-1696)

###### Reversal
Some people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and ignoble. They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice, which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for help, you emphasize their power and position. They are strong enough to need nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce you to powerful peopleprovided, of course, that all this is done in public, and for a good cause (usually the more public, the better). Not everyone, then, can be approached through cynical self-interest. Some people will be put off by it, because they don't want to seem to be motivated by such things. They need opportunities to display their good heart.

Do not be shy. Give them that opportunity. It's not as if you are conning them by asking for helpit is really their pleasure to give, and to be seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people and figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze greed, do not appeal to meir charity. When they want to look charitable and noble, do not appeal to their greed.
