#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 
###### intro
The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.

###### Corps
La capacité à savoir exploiter l’imagination des masses est un grand pouvoir. 

Lorsque la vérité est laide et déplaisante, nous avons tendance à la fuir et haïr les porteurs de mauvaises nouvelles. Ainsi, ceux qui sont capables d’enjoliver la réalité par de belles histoires auront l’attention du public. La clé est de laisser les gens s’en approcher assez près pour être tenté, mais en les maintenant assez loin pour qu’il continue à rêver.

Ne rappelez jamais la réalité, sous peine d’avoir à affronter la colère, fille de la déception. 
La vie est si dure et si angoissante que ceux qui l’enjolivent par de belles histoires sont tels des oasis dans le désert : tout le monde afflue vers eux. C’est un grand pouvoir que de savoir exploiter l’imagination des masses.

Such is the power of the fantasies that take root in us, especially in times of scarcity and decline. People rarely believe that their problems arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out there is to blamethe other, the world, the godsand so salvation comes from the outside as well. Had Bragadino arrived in Venice armed with a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the city's economic decline, and of the hard-nosed steps that it could take to turn things around, he would have been scorned. 
The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful mostly the kind of hard work that the citizens' ancestors had mustered to create an empire. Fantasy, on the other hand - in this case the romance of alchemy was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable.

To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around you and pleasure comes from playing to people's fantasies. 
Never promise a gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the moon, the great and sudden transformation, **the pot of gold.**

No man need despair of gaining converts to the most extravagant hypothesis who has art enough to represent it in favorable colors.
David Hume, 1711-1776


The fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must not come too close, though, for the physical hinders the power of fantasy; it can be seen, grasped, and then tired of the fate of most courtesans. The bodily charms of the mistress only whet the master's appetite for more and different pleasures, a new beauty to adore.
To bring power, fantasy must remain to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari, for instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I, had quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of being strange'and exotic, unknowable and indecipherable. The taboo she worked with was less sex itself than the breaking of social codes.

Anodier form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief from boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the working world, its lack of adventure.


###### Remember: The key to fantasy is distance.
The distant has allure and promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, then, should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the mirage in the distance, withdrawing as die sucker approaches. Never be too direct in describing the fantasykeep it vague. As a forger of fantasies, let your victim come close enough to see and be tempted, but keep him far away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.


###### Image: The Moon. 
Unattainable, always changing shape, disappearing and reappearing. We look at it, imagine, wonder, and pinenever familiar, continuous provoker of dreams. Do not offer the obvious. Promise the moon.

###### Authority: 
A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be embellished into a fantasy. It can be clothed in the raiments of a mystic conception. Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. A lie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is the one who always tells the truth, who never romances. . . . I found it far more interesting and profitable to romance than to tell the truth. (Joseph Weil, a.k.a. “The Yellow Kid,” 1875-1976)

###### Reversal:
If there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there is also danger. Fantasy usually contains an element of playdie public half realizes it is being duped, but it keeps die dream alive anyway, relishing the entertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday mat you are providing. So keep it lightnever come too close to the place where you are actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely hazardous.

After Bragadino established himself in Munich, he found that the sober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the temperamental Venetians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it desperately to rescue him from die hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and expecting patience, the public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results. In 1592 the Bavarians demanded justice, and eventually Bragadino found himself swinging from the gallows. As before, he had promised and had not delivered, but this time he had misjudged the forbearance of his hosts, and his inability to fulfill tiieir fantasy proved fatal.

One last tiling: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is always fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is sometimes so theatrical and stylized that fantasy becomes a desire for simple things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of himself, for example, as a homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man's president.

P. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and lampooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen Victoria, by appealing to the fantasy of the time: Enough of the vainglorious rulers of history, the common man knows best. Tom Thumb reversed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown becomes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for underlying it was the fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier than the powerful and the rich.

Both Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully maintained their distance. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too must carefully cultivate distance and not allow your “common” persona to become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy.
