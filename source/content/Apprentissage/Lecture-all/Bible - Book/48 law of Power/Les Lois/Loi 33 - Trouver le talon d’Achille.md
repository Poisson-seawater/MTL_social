###### intro
Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage.

###### Corps
Tout le monde a un point faible, une fissure dans le rempart de sa personnalité : un sentiment d’insécurité, une émotion incontrôlable, un besoin criant, voire un péché mignon.

Celui qui découvre le point faible de quelqu’un acquiert du pouvoir sur lui. Plusieurs astuces pour identifier la faiblesse d’un individus :
- Etre attentif aux comportements et signaux inconscients
- Retrouver l’enfant sans défense
- Rechercher les contrastes (les qualités trahissent souvent les faiblesses qu’elles veulent cacher)
- Combler le vide
- Miser sur les pulsions incontrôlables


#### FINDING THE THUMBSCREW: A Strategic Plan of Action 
We all have resistances.
We live with a perpetual armor around ourselves to defend against change and the intrusive actions of friends and rivals
We would like nothing more than to be left to do things our own way. 

One of the most important things to realize about people, though, is that they all have a weakness, some part of their psychological armor that will not resist, that will bend to your will if you find it and push on it. Some people wear their weaknesses openly, others disguise them. Those who disguise them are often the ones most effectively undone through that one chink in their armor.

In planning your assault, keep these principles in mind:

###### Pay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. 
As Sigmund Freud remarked, “No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.” This is a critical concept in the search for a person's weaknessit is revealed by seemingly unimportant gestures and passing words.

The key is not only what you look for but where and how you look. Everyday conversation supplies the richest mine of weaknesses, so train yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interested the appearance of a sympathetic ear will spur anyone to talk. 
A clever trick, often used by the nineteenth-century French statesman Talleyrand, is to appear to open up to the other person, to share a secret with diem. It can be completely made up, or it can be real but of no great importance to youthe important thing is that it should seem to come from the heart. 
This will usually elicit a response that is not only as frank as yours but more genuine - a response that reveals a weakness. -> [spy]

If you suspect that someone has a particular soft spot, probe for it indirectly. 
If, for instance, you sense that a man has a need to be loved, openly flatter him. 
If he laps up your compliments, no matter how obvious, you are on the right track. 
Train your eye for details:
- how someone tips a waiter, 
- what delights a person,
- the hidden messages in clothes. 

Find people's idols, the things they worship and will do anything to get perhaps you can be the supplier of their fantasies. 

Remember: Since we all try to hide our weaknesses, there is little to be learned from our conscious behavior. What oozes out in the little things outside our conscious control is what you want to know.

###### Find the Helpless Child. 
Most weaknesses begin in childhood, before the self builds up compensatory defenses. Perhaps the child was pampered or indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain emotional need went unfulfilled; as he or she grows older, the indulgence or the deficiency may be buried but never disappears. Knowing about a childhood need gives you a powerful key to a person's weakness.

One sign of this weakness is that when you touch on it the person will often act like a child. Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior that should have been outgrown. 
If your victims or rivals went without something important, such as parental support, when they were children, supply it, or its facsimile. 
If they reveal a secret taste, a hidden indulgence, indulge it. In either case they will be unable to resist you.

###### Look for Contrasts. 
An overt trait often conceals its opposite. People who thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish exterior may hide a lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for adventure; the shy are dying for attention. By probing beyond appearances, you will often find people's weaknesses in the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you.

###### Find the Weak Link.
Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it is not what but who that matters. In today's versions of the court, there is often someone behind the scenes who has a great deal of power, a tremendous influence over the person superficially on top. These behind-the-scenes powerbrokers are die group's weak link: Win their favor and you indirectly influence the king. Alternatively, even in a group of people acting with the appearance of one willas when a group under attack closes ranks to resist an outsiderthere is always a weak link in the chain. Find the one person who will bend under pressure.

###### Fill the Void. 
The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity and un-happiness. The insecure are suckers for any kind of social validation; as for the chronically unhappy, look for the roots of their unhappiness. 
The insecure and the unhappy are the people least able to disguise their weaknesses. The ability to fill their emotional voids is a great source of power, and an indefinitely prolongable one.

###### Feed on Uncontrollable Emotions. 
The uncontrollable emotion can be a paranoid fear - a fear disproportionate to the situationor any base motive such as lust, greed, vanity, or hatred. 
People in the grip of these emotions often cannot control themselves, and you can do the controlling for them.


###### Remember: 
When entering the court, find the weak link. The person in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes the favorite, the husband or wife, even thie court fool. 
This person may have more weaknesses than the king himself, because his power depends on all kinds of capricious factors outside his control.


When searching for suckers, always look for the dissatisfied, me unhappy, the insecure. Such people are riddled with weaknesses and have needs mat you can fill. Their neediness is the groove in which you place your thumbnail and turn them at will.

Always look for passions and obsessions that cannot be controlled. The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable die person. This may seem surprising, for passionate people look strong. In fact, however, they are simply filling the stage with their theatricality, distracting people from how weak and helpless they really are. A man's need to conquer women actually reveals a tremendous helplessness that has made suckers out of them for thousands of years. Look at the part of a person that is most visible their greed, their lust, their intense fear. These are the emotions they cannot conceal, and over which they have the least control. And what people cannot control, you can control for them.

People's need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.
First, it is almost universal; 
second, exploiting it is so very easy. 
All you have to do is find ways to make people feel better about their taste, their social standing, their intelligence. Once the fish are hooked, you can reel them in again and again, for years you are filling a positive role, giving them what they cannot get on their own. They may never suspect that you are turning them like a thumbscrew, and if they do they may not care, because you are making them feel better about themselves, and that is worth any price.

###### Arthur Schopenhauer
And while I am on the subject, there is another fact that deserves mention. It is this. A man shows his character just in the way in which he deals with triflesfor then he is off his guard. This will often afford a good opportunity of observing the boundless egoism of a man's nature, and his total lack of consideration for others; and if these defects show themselves in small things, or merely in his general demeanour, you will find that they also underlie his action in matters of importance, although he may disguise the fact. This is an opportunity which should not be missed. If in the little affairs of every daythe trifles of life ...a man is inconsiderate and seeks only what is advantageous or convenient to himself, to the prejudice of others' rights; if he appropriates to himself that which belongs to all alike, you may be sure there is no justice in his heart, and that he would be a scoundrel on a wholesale scale, only that law and compulsion bind his hands.

#### Image: The Thumbscrew. 
Your enemy has secrets that he guards, thinks thoughts he will not reveal. But they come out in ways he cannot help. It is there somewhere, a groove of weakness on his head, at his heart, over his belly. Once you find the groove, put your thumb in it and turn him at will.


###### Authority: 
Find out each man's thumbscrew. Tis the art of setting their wills in action. It needs more skill than resolution. You must know where to get at anyone. Every volition has a special motive which varies according to taste. All men are idolaters, some of fame, odiers of self-interest, most of pleasure. Skill consists in knowing these idols in order to bring them into play. Knowing any man's mainspring of motive you have as it were the key to his will. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal:
Playing on people's weakness has one significant danger: You may stir up an action you cannot control.

In your games of power you always look several steps ahead and plan accordingly. And you exploit the fact that other people are more emotional and incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their vulnerabilities, the areas over which they have least control, you can unleash emotions that will upset your plans. Push timid people into bold action and they may go too far; answer their need for attention or recognition and they may need more than you want to give them. The helpless, childish element you are playing on can turn against you.

The more emotional the weakness, die greater the potential danger. Know the limits to this game, then, and never get carried away by your control over your victims. You are after power, not die dirill of control.
