###### intro
By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.

###### Corps
> Au lieu d’adopter des contours définis qui donneront prise à votre ennemi, restez adaptable et mobile. 
> - be like water

Du fait que tout change, il faut rester adaptable et mobile. En suivant un plan fixe, en gravant son plan dans le roc, en se reposant sur la stabilité, on devient prévisible et vulnérable.

Le pouvoir, c’est comprendre que rien n’est immuable et donc d’agir avec fluidité. C'est d'acceptez que rien n’est certain, qu’aucune loi n’est immuable.

La meilleure façon de vous protéger est d’être aussi fluide et insaisissable que l’eau ; ne comptez jamais sur la stabilité ni sur l’immobilité. Tout change.
- *pensé a l'ordre Jedi*


assume formlessness. No predator alive can attack what it cannot see.
-> Fable du chien aux oreilles coupé, du a ses oreilles disparue, ses enemis ne savent pas par ou l'attaquer.


The human animal is distinguished by its constant creation of forms. Rarely expressing its emotions directiy, it gives them form through language, or through socially acceptable rituals. We cannot communicate our emotions without a form.
The forms that we create, however, change constantiyin fashion, in style, in all those human phenomena representing the mood of the moment. We are constantly altering the forms we have inherited from previous generations, and these changes are signs of life and vitality. Indeed, the tilings that don't change, the forms that rigidify, come to look to us like death, and we destroy them.
The young show this most clearly: Uncomfortable with the forms that society imposes upon them, having no set identity, they play with their own characters, trying on a variety of masks and poses to express themselves. This is the vitality that drives the motor of form, creating constant changes in style.
The powerful are often people who in their youth have shown immense creativity in expressing something new through a new form. Society grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort of newness. The problem comes later, when they often grow conservative and possessive. 
They no longer dream of creating new forms; their identities are set, their habits congeal, and their rigidity makes them easy targets. Everyone knows their next move. Instead of demanding respect they elicit boredom: Get off the stage! we say, let someone else, someone younger, entertain us. When locked in the past, the powerful look comicalthey are overripe fruit, waiting to fall from the tree.


The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to [[Ego is the enemy - note|take nothing personally]]. Never show any defensiveness. When you act defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a clear form. Your opponents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles' heel. And they will hit it again and again. So train yourself to take nothing personally. Never let anyone get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that cannot be held: Let no one know what gets to you, or where your weaknesses he. Make your face a formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming colleagues and opponents.


The need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form.
We become predictable, always the first sign of decrepitude. And predictability makes us appear comical. Although ridicule and disdain might seem mild forms of attack, they are actually potent weapons, and will eventually erode a foundation of power. An enemy who does not respect you will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest animal dangerous.

As you get older, you must rely even less on the past. Be vigilant lest the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter of mimicking the fashions of youththat is equally worthy of laughter. Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each circumstance, even the inevitable change that the time has come to move over and let those of younger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you look uncannily like a cadaver.
-> [[Loi 41 - Ne succéder à personne|Never stay in your parent shadow nor yours !!]]



Never forget, though, that formlessness is a strategic pose. It gives you room to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a decided disadvantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your enemies in the position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils their spying and intelligence. Remember: Formlessness is a tool. Never confuse it with a go-with-the-flow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You use formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but because it will increase your power.

Finally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do, and the sage advice of the elder. “The laws that govern circumstances are abolished by new circumstances,” Napoleon wrote, which means that it is up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people's ideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much respect for other people's wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be brutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the philosophies that are foisted on you from outside.




###### Mao Tse-tung, 1893-1976
When you want to fight us, we don't let you and you can't find us. But when we want to fight you, we make sure that you can't get away and we hit you squarely . . . and wipe you out. . . . The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.

###### THE ART OF WINNING WARS, James Mrazek, 1968
General Rommel surpassed Patton as a creative intellect.... Rommel shunned military formalism. He made no fixed plans beyond those intended for the initial clash; thereafter, he tailored his tactics to meet specific situations as they arose. He was a lightning-fast decisionmaker, physically maintaining a pace that matched his active mentality. In a forbidding sea of sand, he operated in a free environment. Once Rommel ruptured the British lines in Africa, he had the whole northern part of the continent opened to him. Comparatively free from the hamstringing authority of Berlin, disregarding orders even from Hitler himself on occasion, Rommel implemented one successful operation after another until he had most of North Africa under his control and Cairo trembling at his feet.


###### Avantage "Faire preuve d’adaptabilité"
L'adaptabilité permet de dérouter l’adversaire (qui devient confut) et ainsi d'accroître sa vulnérabilité.

###### Image: The winged messenger,
God of commerce, patron saint of thieves, gamblers, and all those who deceive through swiftness. 

The day Mercury was born he invented die lyre; by that evening he had stolen the cattle of Apollo. He would scour the world, assuming whatever form he desired. Like the liquid metal named after him, he embodies the elusive, the ungraspablethe power of formlessness.


###### Authority: 
Therefore the consummation of forming an army is to arrive at formlessness. Victory in war is not repetitious, but adapts its form endlessly. ... A military force has no constant formation, water has no constant shape: The ability to gain victory by changing and adapting according to the opponent is called genius. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.)
###### Reversal:
Using space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not mean forsaking the concentration of your power when it is valuable to you. Formlessness makes your enemies hunt all over for you, scattering their own forces, mental as well as physical. When you finally engage them, though, hit them with a powerful, concentrated blow. That is how Mao succeeded against the Nationalists: He broke their forces into small, isolated units, which he then could easily overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of concentration prevailed.

When you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and keep your long-term strategy in mind. When you assume a form and go on the attack, use concentration, speed, and power. As Mao said, “ When we fight you, we make sure you can't get away.”
