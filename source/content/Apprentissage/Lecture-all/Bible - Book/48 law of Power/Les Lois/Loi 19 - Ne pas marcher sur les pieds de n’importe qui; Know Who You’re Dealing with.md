#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs' clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then never offend or deceive the wrong person.

###### Corps

Les gens ne réagissent pas de la même manière. Par exemple, lorsque certains sont trompés ou manipulés, ils passent le reste de leur vie à chercher une occasion de vengeance. C’est pourquoi l’auteur conseille de ne pas malmener n’importe qui. 
Il recommande d’éviter de se mesurer à cinq types de profil : 
- l’arrogant, 
- l’hésitant chronique,
- le soupçonneux, 
- le serpent à la mémoire d’éléphant 
- et le brute idiote.

> When you meet a swordsman, draw your sword: Do not recite poetry to one who is not a poet.
> \- From a Ch'an Buddhist classic, quoted in thunder in the sky, translated by Thomas Cleary, 1993

If someone insulte youremeber [Pyrrhic victory], cost of answering and [law 36].

In your rise to power you will come across many breeds of opponent, sucker, and victim. 
The highest form of the art of power is the ability to distinguish the wolves from die lambs, the foxes from the hares, the hawks from the vultures. If you make this distinction well, you will succeed without needing to coerce anyone too much. But if you deal blindly with whomever crosses your path, you will have a life of constant sorrow, if you even live that long.

-> Histoire de Lope de Aguirre.

The ability to measure people and to know who you're dealing with is the most important skill of all in gathering and conserving power. 
Without it you are blind: Not only will you offend the wrong people, you will choose the wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when you are actually insulting them. 
Before embarking on any move, take the measure of your mark or potential opponent. Otherwise you will waste time and make mistakes. Study people's weaknesses, the chinks in their armor, their areas of body, pride and insecurity. Know their ins and outs before you even decide whether or not to deal with them.
-> [spying !!]

RULES:
1. never thrust instinct only for judging people
	1. -> [SPY !!!] gather information
2. never trust appearance
	1. or the version people present you with.

###### The Arrogant and Proud Man. 
Although he may initially disguise it, tiiis man's touchy pride makes him very dangerous. Any perceived slight will lead to a vengeance of overwhelming violence. You may say to yourself, “But I only said such-and-such at a party, where everyone was drunk. ...” It does not matter. There is no sanity behind his overreaction, so do not waste time trying to figure him out. If at any point in your dealings with a person you sense an oversensitive and overactive pride, flee. Whatever you are hoping for from him isn't worth it.

###### The Hopelessly Insecure Man. 
This man is related to the proud and arrogant type, but is less violent and harder to spot. His ego is fragile, his sense of self insecure, and if he feels himself deceived or attacked, the hurt will simmer. He will attack you in bites that will take forever to get big enough for you to notice. If you find you have deceived or harmed such a man, disappear for a long time. Do not stay around him or he will nibble you to death.

###### Mr. Suspicion. 
Another variant on the breeds above, this is a future Joe Stalin. 
He sees what he wants to see usually the worst in other people, and imagines that everyone is after him. 
Mr. Suspicion is in fact the least dangerous of the three: Genuinely unbalanced, he is easy to deceive, just as Stalin himself was constandy deceived. 
Play on his suspicious nature to get him to turn against other people. But if you do become the target of his suspicions, watch out.

###### The Serpent with a Long Memory.
If hurt or deceived, this man will show no anger on the surface; he will calculate and wait. 
Then, when he is in a position to turn the tables, he will exact a revenge marked by a coldblooded shrewdness. Recognize this man by his calculation and cunning in the different areas of his life. 
He is usually cold and unaffectionate. Be doubly careful of this snake, and if you have somehow injured him, either crush him completely or get him out of your sight.


###### The Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man.
Ah, your ears prick up when you find such a tempting victim. But this man is a lot harder to deceive than you imagine. Falling for a ruse often takes intelligence and imagination - a sense of the possible rewards. 
The blunt man will not take the bait because he does not recognize it. He is that unaware. 
The danger wiyth this man is not mat he will harm you or seek revenge, but merely that he will waste your time, energy, resources, and even your sanity in trying to deceive him. 
Have a test ready for a mark - a joke, a story. 
If his reaction is utterly literal, this is the type you are dealing with. Continue at your own risk.

###### Tips
Never assume that the person you are dealing with is weaker or less important than you are. 
Some men are slow to take offense, which may make you misjudge the thickness of their skin, and fail to worry about insulting them. 
But should you offend their honor and their pride, they will overwhelm you with a violence that seems sudden and extreme given their slowness to anger. 

If you want to turn people down, it is best to do so politely and respectfully, even if you feel their request is impudent or their offer ridiculous. 
-> Never reject them with an insult until you know them better; you may be dealing with a Genghis Khan.


###### Self estime and insecurity
Most men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of resignation. They learn their lesson, recognizing that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by their own greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their medicine. Instead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice, they see themselves as totally innocent victims.

Men like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty, but they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being conned, has activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair the damage.

All people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a sucker is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power, everything is a question of degree, and the person who is decidedly more insecure than the average mortal presents great dangers. Be warned: If you practice deception or trickery of any sort, study your mark well. Some people's insecurity and ego fragility cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To see if you are dealing with such a type, test them firstmake, say, a mild joke at their expense. A confident person will laugh; an overly insecure one will react as if personally insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with this type, find another victim.
###### Image: The Hunter.
He does not lay the same trap for a wolf as for a fox. He does not set bait where no one will take it. He knows his prey thoroughly, its habits and hideaways, and hunts accordingly.

###### Authority: 
Be convinced, that there are no persons so insignificant and inconsiderable, but may, some time or other, have it in their power to be of use to you; which they certainly will not, if you have once shown them contempt. Wrongs are often forgiven, but contempt never is. Our pride remembers it for ever. (Lord Chesterfield, 1694-1773)

###### Reversal: 
What possible good can come from ignorance about other people Learn to tell die lions from the lambs or pay the price. Obey this law to its fullest extent; it has no reversaldo not bother looking for one.
