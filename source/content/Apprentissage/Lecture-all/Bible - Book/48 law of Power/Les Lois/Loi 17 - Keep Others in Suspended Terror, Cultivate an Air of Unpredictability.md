#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people's actions. Your predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.

###### Corps
 > Soyez délibérément imprévisible. 

L’homme est féru d’habitudes, surtout chez autrui. Quand vous ne surprenez plus personne, vous donnez aux autres l’impression qu’ils vous ont percé à jour.


Le fait de se comporter sans rime ni raison est un puissant levier pour déstabiliser les gens. Être délibérément imprévisible permet de :

- Perturber les habitudes des gens
- Les empêcher de discerner les motivations derrières nos actes 
- Faire sensation et d’éveiller l’intérêt

Un comportement sans rime ni raison 
- déstabilisera les gens, 
- ils s’épuiseront à faire l’exégèse de vos actes. 
- ET: Cette stratégie peut intimider, voire même susciter la terreur

###### Pourquoi "Brouillez les pistes"
Vous déstabiliserez ainsi vos adversaires
###### Image: The Cyclone. 
A wind that cannot be foreseen. Sudden shifts in the barometer, inexplicable changes in direction and velocity. There is no defense: A cyclone sows terror and confusion.

###### Authority: 
The enlightened ruler is so mysterious that he seems to dwell nowhere, so inexplicable that no one can seek him. He reposes in nonaction above, and his ministers tremble below. (Han-fei-tzu, Chinese philosopher, third century B.C.)


###### Reversal:
Sometimes predictability can work in your favor: By creating a pattern for people to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull them to sleep. They have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions about you. You can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen, a comfortable front behind which you can carry on deceptive actions. Second, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against the pattern, unsettling your opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground wimout being pushed.

A warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, especially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it is better to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to disturb them. Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness, or even of some more serious psychic problem. Patterns are powerful, and you can terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be used judiciously.
