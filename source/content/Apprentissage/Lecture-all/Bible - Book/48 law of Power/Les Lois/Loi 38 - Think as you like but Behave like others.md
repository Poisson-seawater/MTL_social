#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who an sure to appreciate your uniqueness.

###### Corps
Si vous affichez des opinions à contre-courant, anticonformistes, peu orthodoxes, on pensera que vous vous croyez plus malin que les autres et que vous les prenez de haut, et l’on cherchera à vous en faire passer l’envie. 

Les gens n’apprécient pas (voire combattent) ceux qui affichent des opinions contraires et à contre-courant des leurs. Ainsi, il peut être judicieux de se fondre dans la masse, de dire aux gens ce qu’ils veulent entendre et veiller à ne pas les heurter, tout en masquant ses propres opinions.

Ne partagez vos idées qu’avec des amis tolérants et sûrs qui apprécient votre originalité.



As Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, “By his contempt for the laws and his imitation of foreign ways he had made himself very widely suspected of being unwilling to abide by normal standards.” Cultures have norms that reflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not expect to scoff at such things with impunity. You will be punished somehow, even if just through isolationa position of real powerlessness.
Many of us, like Pausanias, feel the siren call of the exotic, the foreign. Measure and moderate diis desire. Flaunting your pleasure in alien ways of thinking and acting will reveal a different motiveto demonstrate your superiority over your fellows.

In the face of awesome persecution, Campanella devised three strategic moves that saved his hide, freed him from prison, and allowed him to continue to express his beliefs. First he feigned madnessthe medieval equivalent of disavowing responsibility for one's actions, like blaming one's parents today. Next he wrote a book that expressed the exact opposite of his own beliefs. Finally, and most brilliantiy of all, he disguised his ideas while insinuating them at the same time. It is an old but powerful trick: You pretend to disagree with dangerous ideas, but in die course of your disagreement you give diose ideas expression and exposure. You seem to conform to die prevailing orthodoxy, but diose who know will understand die irony involved. You are protected.

It is inevitable in society that certain values and customs lose contact with dieir original motives and become oppressive. And mere will always be those who rebel against such oppression, harboring ideas far ahead of their time. As Campanella was forced to realize, however, there is no point in making a display of your dangerous ideas if diey only bring you suffering and persecution. Martyrdom serves no purposebetter to live on in an oppressive world, even to dirive in it. Meanwhile find a way to express your ideas subdy for diose who understand you. Laying your pearls before swine will only bring you trouble.

Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conventional behavior and mouth conventional ideas widiout having to believe in diem. The power these people gain from blending in is that of being left alone to have die thoughts tfiey want to have, and to express diem to the people they want to express them to, without suffering isolation or ostracism. Once tiiey have established themselves in a position of power, they can try to convince a wider circle of the correctness of dieir ideas perhaps working indirecdy, using Campanella's strategies of irony and insinuation.

> If you stick to conventional appearances in public few will believe you think differendy in private.

Not only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and Salk, they also learn to play the clever fox and feign the common touch. This has been the ploy of con artists and politicians throughout the centuries. Leaders like Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt have overcome their natural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity with the common man. They have expressed this familiarity in little gestures, often symbolic, to show the people that their leaders share popular values, despite their different status.

The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the group in which you find yourself.

People will swallow the bait because it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas. They will not take you as a hypocrite if you are careful - for how can they accuse you of hypocrisy if you do not let them know exactly what you stand for? Nor will they see you as lacking in values. Of course you have values - the values you share with them, while in their company.


###### Niccolo Machiavelli
For a long time I have not said what I believed, nor do I ever believe what I say, and if indeed sometimes I do happen to tell the truth,
I hide it among so many lies that it is hard to find.

Niccolo Machiavelli, in a letter to Francesco Guicciardini, May 17, 1521
###### Arthur Schopenhauer
If you feel irritated by the absurd remarks of two people whose conversation you happen to overhear, you should imagine that you are listening to the dialogue of two fools in a comedy. Probatum est. The man who comes into the world with the notion that he is really going to instruct it in matters of the highest importance, may thank his stars if he escapes with a whole skin.

###### Image: The Black sheep
The herd shuns the black sheep, uncertain whether or not it belongs with them. So it straggles behind, or wanders away from the herd, where it is cornered by wolves and promptly devoured. Stay with the herd there is safety in numbers. Keep your differences in your thoughts and not in your fleece.

###### Authority: 
Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not dirow your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you. (Jesus Christ, Matthew 7:6)

###### Reversal:
The only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand out when you have achieved an unshakable position of power, and can display your difference from others as a sign of the distance between you. As president of the United States, Lyndon Johnson would sometimes hold meetings while he sat on the toilet. Since no one else either could or would claim such a “privilege,” Johnson was showing people that he did not have to observe the protocols and niceties of others. The Roman emperor Caligula played the same game: He would wear a woman's negligee, or a bathrobe, to receive important visitors. He even went so far as to have his horse elected consul. But it backfired, for the people hated Caligula, and his gestures eventually brought his overthrow. The truth is that even those who attain the heights of power would be better off at least affecting the common touch, for at some point they may need popular support.

Finally, there is always a place for the gadfly, the person who successfully defies custom and mocks what has grown lifeless in a culture. Oscar Wilde, for example, achieved considerable social power on this foundation: He made it clear that he disdained the usual ways of doing things, and when he gave public readings his audiences not only expected him to insult them but welcomed it. We notice, however, that his eccentric role eventually destroyed him. Even had he come to a better end, remember that he possessed an unusual genius: Without his gift to amuse and delight, his barbs would simply have offended people.
