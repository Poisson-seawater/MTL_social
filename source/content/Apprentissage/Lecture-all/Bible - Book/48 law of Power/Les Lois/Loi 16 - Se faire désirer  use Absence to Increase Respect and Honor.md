# Loi 16 : Se faire désirer: use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor
###### intro
Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity

###### Corps
> La rareté augmente la valeur 

Absence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, as the wind douses a candle and fans afire.
\- La Rochefoucauld, 1613-1680

A l’inverse, plus on est visible et présent plus on semble ordinaire. Pour accéder au pouvoir,  il convient donc d’apprendre à s’éloigner de temps en temps pour jouer sur le sentiment d’absence.

Si vous faites partie d’un groupe, 
- éloignez-vous en un certain temps et l’on parlera davantage, vous serez même plus admiré. 
- pratiquez l’absence

Napoléon Bonaparte, 1769-1821 : « *Si l’on me voit trop au théâtre, les gens cesseront de me remarquer*. »
###### Image:  The Sun. 
It can only be appreciated by its absence.
The longer the days of rain, the more the sun is craved. But too many hot days and the sun overwhelms.

Learn to keep yourself obscure and make people demand your return.

A man said to a Dervish: “Why do I not see you more often ” The Dervish replied, "Because the words 'Why have you not been to see me' are sweeter to my ear than the words 'Why have you come again'"
\ - Mulla Jami, quoted in Idries Shah's Caravan of Dreams, 1968

###### In love 
The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the lover's absence stimulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around him or her. But mis aura fades when you know too muchwhen your imagination no longer has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth-century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at withdrawal from one's lover. “Love never dies of starvation,” she wrote, “but often of indigestion.”

###### Authority: 

Extend the law of scarcity to your own skills ([loi 11]). Make what you are offering the world rare and hard to find, and you instandy increase its value.

Authority. Use absence to create respect and esteem. If presence diminishes fame, absence augments it. A man who when absent is regarded as a lion becomes when present something common and ridiculous. Talents lose their luster if we become too familiar with them, for the outer shell of the mind is more readily seen than its rich inner kernel. Even the outstanding genius makes use of retirement so that men may honor him and so that the yearning aroused by his absence may cause him to be esteemed. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal
This law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The need to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence; leave too early and you do not increase your respect, you are simply forgotten. When you are first entering onto the world's stage, create an image that is recognizable, reproducible, and is seen everywhere. Until that status is attained, absence is dangerousinstead of fanning the flames, it will extinguish them.

In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you have surrounded the other with your image, been seen by him or her everywhere. Everything must remind your lover of your presence, so that when you do choose to be away, the lover will always be thinking of you, will always be seeing you in his or her mind's eye.

Remember: In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but omnipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed in its absence.
