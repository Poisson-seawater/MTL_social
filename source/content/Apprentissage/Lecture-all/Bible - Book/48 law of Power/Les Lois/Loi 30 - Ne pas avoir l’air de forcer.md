Cha - no - yo => Japanese Tea Ceremony.

###### intro
Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you workit only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.

###### Corps
Vos actes doivent paraître naturels et exécutés avec aisance. Cachez la sueur et le sang qu’ils vous ont coûté, et taisez les trouvailles géniales qui vous ont simplifié la tâche.

Il faut donner l’impression d’agir toujours en souplesse, comme si l’on pouvait faire beaucoup plus. 

Si vous avez l’air de ployer sous le faix, les gens se poseront des questions.  
PLUS: When you let this information out, you give people ideas they can use against you. You lose the advantages of keeping silent. 
We tend to want the world to know what we have donewe want our vanity gratified by having our hard work and cleverness applauded, and we may even want sympathy for the hours it has taken to reach our point of artistry. Learn to control this propensity to blab, for its effect is often the opposite of what you expected. 
Remember: The more [mystery] surrounds your actions, the more awesome your power seems.
You appear to be the only one who can do what you do and the appearance of having an exclusive gift is immensely powerful. 
Finally, because you achieve your accomplishments with grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you tried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. Your powers are untapped no one can fathom their limits.

As a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weakeras if anyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as if they weren't really up to the job. Keep your effort and your tricks to yourself and you seem to have the grace and ease of a god. 
One never sees the source of a god's power revealed; one only sees its effects.

###### Castiglione and Japanese Tea Ceremony
Baldassare Castiglione describes the highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet, Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he calls sprezzfltura, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the courtier to "practice in all tilings a certain nonchalance which conceals all artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effortless.“
We all admire the achievement of some unusual feat, but if it is accomplished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold ”whereas ... to labor at what one is doing and ... to make bones over it, shows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth, to be discounted."

The idea of sprezzfltura is relevant to all forms of power, for power depends vitally on appearances and the illusions you create. Your public actions are like artworks: They must have visual appeal, must create anticipation, even entertain. When you reveal the inner workings of your creation, you become just one more mortal among others. What is understandable is not awe-inspiringwe tell ourselves we could do as well if we had the money and time. Avoid the temptation of showing how clever you areit is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your cleverness.

###### Sen no Rikyub vision
To Sen no Rikyu, the sudden appearance of something naturally, almost accidentally graceful was the height of beauty. This beauty came without warning and seemed effortless. Nature created such things by its own laws and processes, but men had to create their effects through labor and contrivance. And when they showed the effort of producing the effect, the effect was spoiled. The gate came from too far away, the cutting of the lemon looked contrived.

You will often have to use tricks and ingenuity to create your effects the cushions in the snow, the men rowing all nightbut your audience must never suspect the work or the thinking that has gone into them. Nature does not reveal its tricks, and what imitates nature by appearing effortless approximates nature's power.




###### Pourquoi "Donnez l’impression d’accomplir vos tâches avec facilité"
Le laborieux n’a pas bonne presse en entreprise.
On admire ce qui est fait sans effort. -> créer un aura

###### Image: The Racehorse. 
From up close we would see the strain, the effort to control the horse, the labored, painful breathing. But from the distance where we sit and watch, it is all gracefulness, flying through the air. Keep others at a distance and they will only see the ease with which you move.

###### Authority: 
For whatever action [nonchalance] accompanies, no matter how trivial it is, it not only reveals the skill of the person doing it but also very often causes it to be considered far greater than it really is. This is because it makes the onlookers believe that a man who performs well with so much facility must possess even greater skill than he does. (Baldassare Castiglione, 1478-1529)

###### Reversal
The secrecy with which you surround your actions must seem lighthearted in spirit. A zeal to conceal your work creates an unpleasant, almost paranoiac impression: you are taking the game too seriously. Houdini was careful to make the concealment of his tricks seem a game, all part of the show. Never show your work until it is finished, but if you put too much effort into keeping it under wraps you will be like the painter Pontormo, who spent the last years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and only succeeded in driving himself mad. Always keep your sense of humor about yourself.

There are also times when revealing die inner workings of your projects can prove worthwhile. It all depends on your audience's taste, and on the times in which you operate. P. T. Barnum recognized that his public wanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his tricks delighted them, pardy, perhaps, because implicitly debunking people who kept their sources of power hidden from the masses appealed to America's democratic spirit. The public also appreciated the showman's humor and honesty. Barnum took this to the extreme of publicizing his own humbug-gery in his popular autobiography, written when his career was at its height.
As long as die partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is carefully planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the ultimate in cleverness. It gives die audience the illusion of being superior and involved, even while much of what you do remains concealed from them.
