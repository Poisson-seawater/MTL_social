###### intro
No one likes feeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims feel smartand not just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.

> Apprendre à feindre de ne pas savoir

On n’aime pas avoir l’air plus bête que son voisin. Utilisez donc ce stratagème : faites en sorte que ceux que vous visez se croient intelligents, et surtout plus intelligents que vous. Une fois convaincus, ils ne chercheront pas plus loin et ne se méfieront pas de vos agissements.

Rares sont ceux qui résistent aux compliments. Leur fatuité les conduira bien souvent à baisser la garde.

The Chinese have a phrase, “Masquerading as a swine to kill the tiger.” This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter clothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get close, savoring the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh
###### Image: The Opossum. 
In playing dead, the opossum plays stupid.
Many a predator has therefore left it alone. Who could believe that such an ugly, unintelligent, nervous little creature could be capable of such deception.

###### Authority: 
Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man plays this card at times. There are occasions when the highest wisdom consists in appearing not to knowyou must not be ignorant but capable of playing it. It is not much good being wise among fools and sane among lunatics. He who poses as a fool is not a fool. The best way to be well received by all is to clothe yourself in the skin of the dumbest of brutes. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal
To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently learn the truththat you are actually much smarter than you lookthey will admire you more for being discreet than for making your brilliance show. At the start of your climb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You may want to let your bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter than the competition around you. As you climb the ladder, however, you should to some degree try to dampen your brilliance.

There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite when you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.
