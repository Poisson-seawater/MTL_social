#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
You can die from someone else's miseryemotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.

###### Corps
On peut mourir du malheur d’autrui : les états d’âme sont contagieux. En voulant aider celui qui se noie, vous courez seulement à votre perte. Les malchanceux attirent l’adversité, sur eux-mêmes et aussi, peut-être, sur vous. 
==Préférez la compagnie de ceux à qui tout réussit.==


De plus, il est préférable de juger les gens sur les effets qu’ils ont sur le monde et non sur les causes auxquelles ils imputent leurs malheurs.


A nut found itself carried by a crow to the top of a tall campanile, and by falling into a crevice succeeded in escaping its dread fate. It then besought the wall to shelter it, by appealing to it by the grace of God, and praising its height, and the beauty and noble tone of its bells. “Alas,” it went on, “as I have not been able to drop beneath the green branches of my old Father and to lie in the fallow earth covered by his fallen leaves, do you, at least, not abandon me. When I found myself in the beak of the cruel crow I made a vow, that if I escaped I would end my life in a little hole. ” 
At these words, the wall, moved with compassion, was content to shelter the nut in the spot where it had fallen. 
Within a short time, the nut burst open: Its roots reached in between the crevices of the stones and began to push them apart; its-shoots pressed up toward the sky. 
They soon rose above the building, and as the twisted roots grew thicker they began to thrust the walls apart and force the ancient stones from their old places. Then the wall, loo late and in vain, bewailed the cause of its destruction, and in short time it fell in ruin.

Leonardo da Vinci. 1452-1519

When you suspect you are in the presence of an infector, don't argue, don't try to help, don't pass the person on to your friends, or you will become enmeshed. Flee the infector's presence or suffer the consequences.

The reason is simple humans are extremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and even the ways of thinking of those with whom they spend their time.
-> pensé au neurone mirroir

###### Pourquoi "Prenez la roue de ceux qui réussissent"
Au contact de personnes de talent, vous acquerrez par mimétisme une partie de leurs qualités et progresserez.

> People we associate with are critical !! (the 5 people we spent the most time)
> All positive quality can infect us.

The other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more readily understood: There are people who attract happiness to themselves by their good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence. They are a source of pleasure, and you must associate with them to share in the prosperity they draw upon themselves

###### Whom to befriend with
Never associate with those who share your defects - they will reinforce everything that holds you back. 
Only create associations with positive affinities. Make this a rule of life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world.


###### Image: A Virus. 
Unseen, it enters your pores without warning, spreading silently and slowly. Before you are aware of the infection, it is deep inside you.

Infectors can be recognized by the misfortune they draw on themselves, their turbulent past, their long line of broken relationships, their unstable careers, and the very force of their character, which sweeps you up and makes you lose your reason. Be forewarned by these signs of an infector; learn to see the discontent in their eye. Most important of all, do not take pity. Do not enmesh yourself in trying to help. The infector will remain unchanged, but you will be unhinged.

###### Authority: 
Recognize the fortunate so that you may choose their company, and the unfortunate so that you may avoid them. Misfortune is usually the crime of folly, and among those who suffer from it there is no malady more contagious: Never open your door to the least of misfortunes, for, if you do, many others will follow in its train.. . . Do not die of another's misery. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-16

###### Reversal
This law admits of no reversal. Its application is universal. There is nothing to be gained by associating with those who infect you with their misery; there is only power and good fortune to be obtained by associating with the fortunate. Ignore this law at your peril.
