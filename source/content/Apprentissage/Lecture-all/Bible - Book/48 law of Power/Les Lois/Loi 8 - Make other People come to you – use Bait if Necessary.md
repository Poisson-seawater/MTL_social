#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gainsthen attack. You hold the cards.

###### Corps
> Quand on force une personne à agir, on est maître de la situation. 

Il vaut mieux amener un adversaire à soi en le faisant abandonner ses propres plans. Appâtez-le avec des gains fabuleux, puis passez à l’attaque. Vous aurez ainsi les cartes en main.


L’essence du pouvoir réside dans l’habileté à garder l’initiative, à obtenir des autres qu’ils réagissent à nos actions et à les maintenir sur la défensive. 


Pour ce faire, Robert Greene suggère de miser sur la tendance naturelle qu’ont les hommes à s’emporter quand ils sont poussés ou appâtés. 
- Il conseille d’apprendre à maîtriser ses émotions et à ne jamais agir sous le coup de la colère.

###### Pourquoi "Prenez l’initiative"

In the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of chasing here and mere, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I never feel in control ? Why am I always having to react to events instead of directing them ?
The answer is simple: Your idea of power is wrong. You have mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated by the traps you lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than quick victory.

Remember: The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative, to get others to react to your moves, to keep your opponent and those around you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you, you suddenly become the one controlling the situation. And the one who has control has power. 
Two things must happen to place you in this position: 
- You yourself must learn to master your emotions, and never to be influenced by anger; 
- meanwhile, however, you must play on people's natural tendency to react angrily when pushed and baited. 
- In the long run, the ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.



One added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the Japanese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces him to operate in your territory. Being on hostile ground will make him nervous and often he will rush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or meetings, it is always wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice. You have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subdy placed on the defensive.
Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control him. But when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull him, just as Napoleon imagined that he himself was the master of his daring escape and return to power.

> Everything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is attractive enough, the turbulence of your enemies' emotions and desires will blind them to reality. The greedier they become, the more they can be led around.

When you are making people come to you, it is sometimes better to let them know you are forcing their hand. You give up deception for overt manipulation. The psychological ramifications are profound: The person who makes others come to him appears powerful, and demands respect.


###### Image: The Honeyed Bear Trap.
The bear hunter does not chase his prey; a bear that knows it is hunted is nearly impossible to catch and is ferocious if cornered. Instead, the hunter lays traps baited with honey. He does not exhaust himself and risk his life in pursuit He baits, then waits.


###### Authority: 
Good warriors make others come to them, and do not go to others. This is the principle of emptiness and fullness of others and self. When you induce opponents to come to you, then their force is always empty; as long as you do not go to them, your force is always full. Attacking emptiness with fullness is like throwing stones on eggs. (Zhang Yu, eleventh-century commentator on The Art of War)

###### Reversal
Although it is generally the wiser policy to make others exhaust themselves chasing you, there are opposite cases where striking suddenly and aggressively at the enemy so demoralizes him that his energies sink. Instead of making others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead. Fast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it forces the other person to react without the time to tiiink or plan. With no time to think, people make errors of judgment, and are thrown on die defensive. This tactic is the obverse of waiting and baiting, but it serves die same function: You make your enemy respond on your terms.

Men like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to intimidate and control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and demoralizing. You must choose your tactics depending on the situation. If you have time on your side, and know that you and your enemies are at least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to you. If time is against youyour enemies are weaker, and waiting will only give them the chance to recovergive tiiem no such chance. Strike quickly and they have nowhere to go. As the boxer Joe Louis put it, “He can run, but he can't hide.”
