###### intro
The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Forte them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.

###### Corps
> Donnez l’illusion à votre adversaire qu’il maîtrise la situation alors qu'il est devant Charybde ou Scylla ?

Les meilleures supercheries sont celles qui semblent laisser le choix à la victime : elle a l’impression qu’elle maîtrise la situation alors qu’elle est une marionnette entre vos mains.
La meilleure stratégie est de laisser le choix en proposant des alternatives qui joueront en notre faveur quelle que soit l’issue.
Forcez les gens à faire le choix entre deux maux servant tous les deux vos desseins : Ils seront pris de quelque côté qu’ils se tournent.




Words like “freedom,” “options,” and “choice” evoke a power of possibility far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely, the choices we havein the marketplace, in elections, in our jobstend to have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply between A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out of the picture. 
Yet as long as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing options. We “choose” to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to choose.

This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems from the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. The phrase “unlimited options” sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of choices comforts us.

This supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it hard to believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot see that you are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange for a much more powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a narrow range of choices, then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a saying: If you can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that much more prettily.


###### Color the Choices. 
This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As President Richard Nixon's secretary of state, Kissinger considered himself better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could make the best decision on his own. 
But if he tried to determine policy, he would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the best solution compared to the others. 
Time after time, Nixon fell for the bait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed him. This is an excellent device to use on the insecure master.

###### Force the Resister. 
One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. 

His patients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent susceptibility to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see him. 

To avoid this, Erick-son began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel as bad as when they first came into go back to square one. Faced with this option, the patients would usually “choose” to avoid the relapse which, of course, was what Erickson really wanted.

This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to “choose” what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.

###### Alter the Playing Field.
In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out to create an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they would figure out what he was doing and fight back. 

Instead, he began secredy buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he then attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance, he reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them shipping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller altered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had were the ones he gave them.

In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it doesn't matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all costs.

###### The Shrinking Options. 
The late-nineteenth-century art dealer Ambroise Vollard perfected this technique.

Customers would come to Vollard's shop to see some Cezannes. 
He would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time Vollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they were the same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offerings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same thing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Finally the buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing them, because tomorrow they would have to settle for something worse, perhaps at even higher prices.


A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are getting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow.

###### The Weak Man on the Precipice. 
The weak are the easiest to maneuver by controlling their options. 
Cardinal de Retz, the great seventeenth-century provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orleans, who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant struggle to convince the duke to take action - he would hem and haw, weigh the options, and wait till the last moment, giving everyone around him an ulcer. 
But Retz discovered a way to handle him: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exaggerating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in every direction except one: the one Retz was pushing him to take.

This tactic is similar to “**Color the Choices**,” but with the weak you have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions - use fear and terror to propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find a way to procrastinate.

###### Brothers in Crime. 
This is a classic con-artist technique: You attract your victims to some criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt between you.  They participate in your deception, commit a crime (*or think they do - see the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3*), and are easily manipulated. 

Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the 1920s, so entangled the government in his scams and swindles that the state did not dare to prosecute him, and “chose” to leave him alone. 

It is often wise to implicate in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you fail. Their involvement can be subtle - even a hint of their involvement will narrow their options and buy their silence.

###### The Horns of a Dilemma. 
This idea was demonstrated by General William Sherman's infamous march through Georgia during the American Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction Sherman was heading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or the right, for he divided his army into two wingsand if the rebels retreated from one wing they found themselves facing the other. 

This is a classic trial lawyer's technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible explanations of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. 
They have to answer the lawyer's questions, but whatever they say they hurt themselves. 
The key to this move is to strike quickly: Deny the victim the time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the dilemma, they dig their own grave.

###### Understand: 
In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be necessary for you to hurt them. And if you are clearly the agent of their punishment, expect a counter attack, expect revenge. 

If, however, they seem to themselves to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will submit quietly.

When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the citizens asking him to return agreed to his demand for absolute power. Over the years to come, they resented him less for the terror he unleashed on the country, because, after all, they had granted him his power themselves. 

> This is why it is always good to allow your victims their choice of poison, and to cloak your involvement in providing it to them as far as possible.

The bullbacks you into the corner with its hornsnota single horn, which youmight be able to escape, but a pair of hornsthat trap you within theirhold. Run right or runlefteither way youmove into their piercingends and are gored.

###### Authority: 
For the wounds and every other evil that men inflict upon themselves spontaneously, and of their own choice, are in the long run less painful than those inflicted by others. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

###### Reversal
Controlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best, then, for tiiose whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incurring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is rarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and forcefully, no matter how secure or strong you are. It is usually more elegant and more effective to give people the illusion of choice.

On the other hand, by limiting other people's options you sometimes limit your own. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate, you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan your deceptions. The nineteentii-century banker James Rothschild liked this method: He felt that if he tried to control his opponents' movements, he lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effective course. The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more forcefully he could act against them in the long run.
