#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear.
Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.

###### Corps
> Si vous détenez un savoir singulier, alors ne le partagez jamais. 
> Vous placerez ainsi votre entourage en état de dépendance, votre meilleure protection.

-> pensé au Mercenaire d'Italie. 

En étant le garant du bonheur et de la prospérité des autres, on acquiert du pouvoir. Plus on devient indispensable, plus on devient libre. Car, on a rien à craindre de celui qui ne peut se débrouiller sans notre aide. 
==Pour cette onzième loi, la clé est de développer un talent ou une compétence irremplaçable.==

Faites en sorte qu’ils n’en sachent jamais assez pour se débrouiller seuls.

Two horses were carrying two loads. The front Horse went well, but the rear Horse was lazy. The men began to pile the rear Horse's load on the front Horse; when thev had transferred it all. The rear Horse found it easv going, and he said to the front Horse: “Toil and sweat! The more you try, the more yon have to suffer. ” When they reached the tavern, the owner said; “Why should I fodder two horses when I carry all on one I had better give the one all the food it wants, and cut the throat of the other; at least I shall have the hide. ”And so he did.
\- Leo Tolstoy


Necessity rules the world. People rarely act unless compelled to. If you create no need for yourself, then you will be done away with at first opportunity.
If, on the other hand, you understand the Laws of Power and make others depend on you for their welfare, if you can counteract their weakness with your own “iron and blood,” in Bismarck's phrase, then you will survive your masters as Bismarck did. You will have all the benefits of power without the thorns that come from being a master.

Thus a wise prince will think of ways to keep his citizens of every sort and under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him; and then they will always be trustworthy.
\- Nicolas Machiavelli

-> Pensé a l'histoire de l'astrologue de Louis XI.


You do not have to have the talent of a Michelangelo; you do have to have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should create a situation in which you can always latch on to another master or patron but your master cannot easily find another servant with your particular talent. And if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable, you must find a way to make it look as if you are. Having the appearance of specialized knowledge and skill gives you leeway in your ability to deceive those above you into thinking they cannot do without you. Real dependence on your master's part, however, leaves him more vulnerable to you than the faked variety, and it is always within your power to make your skill indispensable.

To make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret-intelligence tactic. By knowing other people's secrets, by holding information that they wouldn't want broadcast, you seal your fate with theirs. You are untouchable. Ministers of secret police have held this position throughout the ages: They can make or break a king, or, as in the case of J. Edgar Hoover, a president. 
But the role is so full of insecurities and paranoia that the power it provides almost cancels itself out. You cannot rest at ease, and what good is power if it brings you no peace

One last warning: Do not imagine that your master's dependence on you will make him love you. In fact, he may resent and fear you. But, as Machiavelli said, it is better to be feared man loved. Fear you can control; love, never. Depending on an emotion as subde and changeable as love or friendship will only make you insecure. Better to have others depend on you out of fear of the consequences of losing you man out of love of your company.

###### Image: Vines with Many Thorns.
Below, the roots grow deep and wide. Above, the vines push through bushes, entwine themselves around trees and poles and window ledges. To get rid of them would cost such toil and blood, it is easier to let them climb.


This is what is meant by the intertwining of fates: Like creeping ivy, you have wrapped yourself around the source of power, so that it would cause great trauma to cut you away. And you do not necessarily have to entwine yourself around the master; another person will do, as long as he or she too is indispensable in the chain.


###### Authority: 
Make people depend on you. More is to be gained from such dependence than courtesy. He who has slaked his thirst, immediately turns his back on the well, no longer needing it. When dependence disappears, so does civility and decency, and then respect. The first lesson which experience should teach you is to keep hope alive but never satisfied, keeping even a royal patron ever in need of you. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

###### Reversal

The weakness of making others depend on you is that you are in some measure dependent on them. But trying to move beyond that point means getting rid of those above youit means standing alone, depending on no one. Such is die monopolistic drive of a J. P. Morgan or a John D. Rockefellerto drive out all competition, to be in complete control. If you can corner the market, so much the better.

No such independence comes without a price. You are forced to isolate yourself. Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves from die internal pressure. They also stir up powerful resentment, making tiieir enemies bond together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often ruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains die law, independence a rare and often fatal exception. Better to place yourself in a position of mutual dependence, then, and to follow this critical law ratfier dian look for its reversal. You will not have die unbearable pressure of being on top, and die master above you will in essence be your slave, for he will depend on you.
