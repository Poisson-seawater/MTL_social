###### intro
Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of powereveryone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around you, then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.

###### Corps
Le recours à des images frappantes et à des gestes symboliquement forts crée une aura de pouvoir : tout le monde y est sensible. 

Mettez-vous en scène, choisissez des symboles visuels impressionnants qui grandissent votre présence et qui attirent l’attention.

Ébloui par l’apparence, nul ne prêtera attention à ce que vous faites réellement.


Tout le monde est sensible à une image frappante ou un geste symbolique et fort. Pour créer une aura de pouvoir, il faut se mettre en scène et choisir des symboles 


Remember: Your search for power depends on shortcuts. You must always circumvent people's suspicions, their perverse desire to resist your will. Images are an extremely effective shortcut: Bypassing the head, the seat of doubt and resistance, they aim straight for the heart. Overwhelming the eyes, they create powerful associations, bringing people together and stirring their emotions. With the white light of the moon in their eyes, your targets are blinded to the deceptions you practice.

You too can play with images like these, weaving visual clues into an encompassing gestalt, as Diane did with her colors and her insignia. Establish a trademark like these to set yourself apart. Then take the game further: Find an image or symbol from the past that will neatly fit your situation, and put it on your shoulders like a cape. It will make you seem larger man life.


Using words to plead your case is risky business: Words are dangerous instruments, and often go astray. The words people use to persuade us virtually invite us to reflect on them with words of our own; we mull them over, and often end up believing the opposite of what they say. (That is part of our perverse nature.) It also happens that words offend us, stirring up associations unintended by the speaker.

The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for reflection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable thoughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the healing powers of the moon, and about his own special connection to a distant object in the sky. Fortunately for him, he was able to create a compelling spectacle that made words unnecessary. The moment his patients entered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently enough.

Understand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to explain yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand, imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates forceful associations, resists unintended interpretations, communicates instantly, and forges bonds that transcend social differences. Words stir up arguments and divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential instruments of power.


The first step in using symbols and images is to understand the primacy of sight among the senses. As Gracian said, “The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.”.
Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color, for example, have enormous symbolic resonance.
The visual contains great emotional power. 

Find and associate yourself with the images and symbols that will communicate in this immediate way today, and you will have untold power.


Most effective of all is a new combinationa fusion of images and symbols that have not been seen together before, but that through their association clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The creation of new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a poetic effect viewers' associations run rampant, giving them a sense of participation.

Visual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which they appear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance, symbolizes power; the image at the center seems to have central importance.

The idea is to give yourself an aura, a stature that your normal banal appearance simply will not create.

Using symbols also has a courtier-like effect, since they are often gentler than brutish words.


The best way to use images and symbols is to organize them into a grand spectacle that awes people and distracts them from unpleasant realities.
This is easy to do: People love what is grand, spectacular, and larger than life. Appeal to their emotions and they will flock to your spectacle in hordes. The visual is the easiest route to their hearts.


###### Image: The Cross and the Sun. (roman Empror Constantin)
Crucifixion and total radiance. With one imposed over the other, a new reality takes shape a new power is in the ascendant. The symbolno explanation necessary.



###### Authority: 
The people are always impressed by the superficial appearance of things.... The [prince] should, at fitting times of the year, keep the people occupied and distracted with festivities and spectacles. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

###### Reversal:
No power is made available by ignoring images and symbols. There is no

possible reversal to this law.
