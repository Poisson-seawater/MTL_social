#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
When you are weaker, never fight for honor's sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating yousurrender first. By turning the other cheek you infuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power.

###### Corps
> Ne lui laissez pas la satisfaction de la victoire : hissez le drapeau blanc. En tendant l’autre joue, vous le rendrez furieux et le déstabiliserez. 

La capitulation peut être un outil de pouvoir. Quand on a le dessous, il est préférable de se rendre et de ne pas continuer pour l’honneur.

En capitulant, on prive l’adversaire de la satisfaction d’une victoire et on se donne le temps 
- de se faire une santé, 
- de tourmenter 
- d’irriter votre vainqueur, 
- d’attendre que son pouvoir périclite.


Weakness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you learn how to play it right. Had the Melians surrendered in the first place, they would have been able to sabotage the Athenians in subtle ways, or might have gotten what they could have out of the alliance and then left it when the Athenians themselves were weakened, as in fact happened several years later. Fortunes change and the mighty are often brought down. Surrender conceals great power: Lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge. Never sacrifice that time in exchange for honor in a battle that you cannot win.

> Weak people never give way when they ought to. 
> \- Cardinal de Retz, 1613-1679



Brecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr and gain a litde public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability to stage their plays and sell their scripts for years to come He felt certain they were

Voltaire was living in exile in London at a time when anti-French sentiment was at its highest. One day walking through the streets, he found himself surrounded by an angry crowd. “Hang him. Hang the Frenchman, ” they yelled. Voltaire calmly addressed the mob with the following words: “Men of England! You wish to kill me because I am a Frenchman. Am I not punished enough in not being born an Englishman” 
The crowd cheered his thoughtful words, and escorted him safely back to his lodgings.

Keep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their authority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of submission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them, they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indirect ridicule used by Brecht. 
Measuring your power over time, never sacrifice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of martyrdom.

###### Image: An Oak Tree. 
The oak that resists the wind loses its branches one by one, and with nothing left to protect it, the trunk finally snaps. The oak that bends lives longer, its trunk growing wider, its roots deeper and more tenacious.

###### Authority: 
Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on titiy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let them have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. (Jesus Christ, in Matthew 5:38-41)


###### Reversal
The point of surrendering is to save your hide for a later date when you can reassert yourself. It is precisely to avoid martyrdom that one surrenders, but there are times when the enemy will not relent, and martyrdom seems the only way out. Furthermore, if you are willing to die, others may gain power and inspiration from your example.

Yet martyrdom, surrender's reversal, is a messy, inexact tactic, and is as violent as die aggression it combats. For every famous martyr there are thousands more who have inspired neither a religion nor a rebellion, so that if martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power, it does so unpredictably. More important, you will not be around to enjoy that power, such as it is. And there is finally something selfish and arrogant about martyrs, as if they felt their followers were less important than their own glory.

When power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law's reversal. Leave martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way eventually, and you should stay alive to see it.
