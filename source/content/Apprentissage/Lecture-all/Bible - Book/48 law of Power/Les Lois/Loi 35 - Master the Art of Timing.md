#swordphilosophy/48LawOfPower 

###### intro
Never seem to be in a hurryhurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition.

###### Corps
Soyez patient : chaque chose vient à son heure. Attendez le bon moment : flairez l’air du temps, les tendances qui vous porteront au pouvoir. Restez en garde tant que l’heure n’est pas venue et portez l’estocade à point nommé.


Plusieurs recommandations :
- Être patient, rester en garde et attendre le moment opportun.
- Changer de rythme pour forcer ses adversaires à abandonner le leur, tout en perturbant leur perception du temps
- Ne jamais se presser car les opportunités non envisagées se présentent avec le temps.

> Space we can recover, time never.

Time is an artificial concept that we ourselves have created to make the limidessness of eternity and the universe more bearable, more human. Since we have constructed the concept of time, we are also able to mold it to some degree, to play tricks with it. 

This is die first thing to understand in mastering the art of timing. If the inner turmoil caused by our emotions tends to make time move faster, it follows that once we control our emotional responses to events, time will move much more slowly. 
This altered way of dealing with things tends to lengthen our perception of future time, opens up possibilities that fear and anger close off, and allows us the patience hiat is the principal requirement in the art of timing.

There are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents problems that can be solved with skill and practice. 

###### long time
First there is long time: the drawn-out, years-long kind of time that must be managed with patience and gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should be mosdy defensivethis is the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting for opportunity.

When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if you had taken your time. Hurriers may occasionally get there quicker, but papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they find themselves in constant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they themselves have created. Sometimes not acting in the face of danger is your best moveyou wait, you deliberately slow down. As time passes it will eventually present opportunities you had not imagined.
Waiting involves controlling not only your own emotions but those of colleagues, who, mistaking action for power, may try to push you into making rash moves. In your rivals, on the other hand, you can encourage this same mistake: If you let them rush headlong into trouble while you stand back and wait, you will soon find ripe moments to intervene and pick up the pieces.

You do not deliberately slow time down to live longer, or to take more pleasure in the moment, but the better to play the game of power. First, when your mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will see further into the future. Second, you will be able to resist the baits that people

dangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming another impatient sucker. Third, you will have more room to be flexible. Opportunities will inevitably arise that you had not expected and would have missed had you forced the pace. Fourth, you will not move from one deal to the next without completing die first one. To build your power's foundation can take years; make sure that foundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the pansuccess that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts.

Finally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come. Hurriers will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing only what they want to see. How much better to see what is really happening, even if it is unpleasant or makes your task harder.


###### forced time
Next there is forced time: the short-term time that we can manipulate as an offensive weapon, upsetting the timing of our opponents. 

The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others to make them hurry, to make them wait, to make them abandon their own pace, to distort their perception of time. By upsetting the timing of your opponent while you stay patient, you open up time for yourself, which is half the game.

Making people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they do not figure out what you are up to. You control the clock, they linger in limboand rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for you to strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful: You make your opponents hurry. 
Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pressure, making them feel that everydiing is happening at once. 
People who lack the time to think will make mistakes so set their deadlines for them.


Jacques Lacan, the famous French psychoanalyst, used a variation on this tactiche would sometimes end the customary hour session of therapy after only ten minutes, without warning. After this happened several times, the patient would realize that he had better make maximum use of the time, rather than wasting much of the hour with a lot of talk that meant nothing. The deadline, then, is a powerful tool.

Close off the vistas of indecision and force people to make up their damn minds or get to the pointnever let them make you play on their excruciating terms. Never give them time.

Magicians have always known that the best way to alter our perception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating suspense brings time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magician's hands move, the easier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has appeared instantaneously. The great nineteenth-century magician Jean-Eugene Robert-Houdin took explicit notice of this effect: “The more slowly a story is told,” he said, “the shorter it seems.”
Going slower also makes what you are doing more interestingthe audience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is a state in which time whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which share in the hypnotist's power to alter perceptions of time.


###### end time
Finally there is end time, when a plan must be executed with speed and force. We have waited, found the moment, and must not hesitate.

You can play the game with the utmost artistry waiting patiently for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their form by messing with their timingbut it won't mean a thing unless you know how to finish.
Do not be one of those people who look like paragons of patience but are actually just afraid to bring things to a close: Patience is worthless unless combined with a willingness to fall ruthlessly on your opponent at the right moment. 
You can wait as long as necessary for the conclusion to come, but when it comes it must come quickly. Use speed to paralyze your opponent, cover up any mistakes you might make, and impress people with your aura of authority and finality.


###### Joseph Fouche
In a period of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouche thrived through his mastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key lessons.

First, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fouche always looked two steps ahead, found the wave mat would carry him to power, and rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate twists and turns, and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the times is obscure: Recognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious in it, but by what lies hidden and dormant. Look forward to the Napoleons of the future rather than holding on to the ruins of the past.

Second, recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean running with them. Any potent social movement creates a powerful reaction, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will be, as Fouche did after the execution of Robespierre. Rather than ride the cresting wave of the moment, wait for the tide's ebb to carry you back to power. Upon occasion bet on the reaction that is brewing, and place yourself in the vanguard of it.

Finally, Fouche had remarkable patience. Without patience as your sword and shield, your timing will fail and you will inevitably find yourself a loser. When the times were against Fouche, he did not struggle, get emotional, or strike out rashly. He kept his cool and maintained a low profile, patiendy building support among the citizenry, the bulwark in his next rise to power. Whenever he found himself in the weaker position, he played for time, which he knew would always be his ally if he was patient. Recognize the moment, then, to hide in die grass or slither under a rock, as well as the moment to bare your fangs and attack.


###### Pourquoi "Ne jamais agir dans la précipitation"
Ne vous pressez jamais : la précipitation trahit un manque de sang froid (perception des autres).
###### Image: Image: The Hawk. 
Patiently and silently it circles the sky, high above, all-seeing with its powerful eyes. Those below have no awareness that they are being tracked. Suddenly, when the moment arrives, the hawk swoops down with a speed that cannot be defended against; before its prey knows what has happened, the bird's viselike talons have carried it up into the sky.

###### Authority: 
There is a tide in the affairs of men, / Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; / Omitted, all the voyage of their life / Is bound in shallows and in miseries. {Julius Caesar, William Shakespeare, 1564-1616)

###### Reversal
There is no power to be gained in letting go of the reins and adapting to whatever time brings. To some degree you must guide time or you will be its merciless victim. There is accordingly no reversal to this law.
