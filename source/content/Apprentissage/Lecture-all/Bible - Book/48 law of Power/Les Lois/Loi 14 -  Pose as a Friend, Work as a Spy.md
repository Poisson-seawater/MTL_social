###### intro
Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. 

Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. 
There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.

###### Corps
> Observez et écoutez, l'information = POUVOIR

En découvrant les secrets et les intentions cachées des gens sans qu’ils s’en aperçoivent on acquiert un avantage inestimable.

Technique: 
- s’appuyer sur des tiers pour collecter de précieuses informations sur ses ennemis. 
- L’idéal reste d’espionner soit même par des questions indirectes, 
- voire laisser filtrer un secret inventé de toutes pièces afin d’observer l’effet produit.

Identifierez  les principaux traits de caractère de votre compétiteur et notamment ses faiblesses, votre meilleur angle d’attaque (cf loi n°33).

Méthode simple MAIS très très risqué !!

Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins through scriptures and the rest oj the people through their normal eyes.
\- Knutilya, Indian philosopher, third century B.C.

In the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events. Part of die problem you face, then, is that people won't tell you all their thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep the most critical parts of their character hiddentheir weaknesses, ulterior motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and are constandy in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find out their secrets and hidden intentions, without letting them know what you are up to.
-> It is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you secredy gather information on friends and enemies alike.

###### Talleyrand
The French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners of this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in polite conversation. 
A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, “Wit and grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words that imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he inject his own personality.”
-> The key here is Talleyrand's ability to suppress himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves and inadvertendy reveal their intentions and plans.

###### Arthur Schopenhauer
If you have reason to suspect that a person is telling you a lie, look as though you believed every word he said. 
This will give him courage to go on; he will become more vehement in his assertions, and in the end betray himself. 
Again, if you perceive that a person is trying to conceal something from you, but with only partial success, look as though you did not believe him. The opposition on your part will provoke him into leading out his reserve of truth and bringing the whole force of it to bear upon your incredulity.

###### Tips
evertheless, you should practice this tactic with caution and care. If people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the cover of conversation, they will stricdy avoid you. Emphasize friendly chatter, not valuable information. Your search for gems of information cannot be too obvious, or your probing questions will reveal more about yourself and your intentions than about the information you hope to find.

A trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote, “Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other.” By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you make mem more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a false confession and they will give you a real one. Another trick was identified by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemendy contradicting people you're in conversation with as a way of irritating mem, stirring them up so that mey lose some of the control over dieir words. In their emotional reaction they will reveal all kinds of truths about themselves, truths you can later use against them.

Another method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay litde traps that make them reveal things about themselves.

###### Image: The Third Eye of the Spy. 
In the land of the two-eyed, the third eye gives you the omniscience of a god. You see further than others, and you see deeper into them. Nobody is safe from the eye but you.

###### Authority: 
Now, the reason a brilliant sovereign and a wise general conquer the enemy whenever they move, and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men, is their foreknowledge of the enemy situation. This “foreknowledge” cannot be elicited from spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor by astrologic calculations. It must be obtained from men who know the enemy situationfrom spies. (Sun-tzu, The Art of War, fourth century B.C.)

###### Reversal
Information is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you must be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most potent weapons in the batde for information, dien, is giving out false information. As Winston Churchill said, “Truth is so precious mat she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.” You must surround yourself with such a bodyguard, so that your truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the information of your choice, you control the game.

In 1944 the Nazis' rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated. Over two diousand V-l flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five thousand people and wounding many more. Somehow, however, the Germans consistendy missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of the city, landing in die less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing tfieir targets, the Germans relied on secret agents they had planted in England. They did not know that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place, English-controlled agents were feeding them subdy deceptive information.

The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent advantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one of your enemy's eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target.
