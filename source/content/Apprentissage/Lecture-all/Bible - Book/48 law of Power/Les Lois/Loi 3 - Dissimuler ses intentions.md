###### intro
Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelop them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.
###### Corps

La clé du pouvoir est d’entretenir l’incertitude et le flou en ne révélant jamais le but qui se cache derrière nos actions. 
SI les gens n’ont aucune idée de ce que l’on prévoit, ALORS ils ne pourront pas préparer de défense. 
- Guidez-les assez loin dans une autre direction,
- enveloppez-les d’un écran de fumée
- et quand ils perceront à jour vos desseins, il sera trop tard.

Il vaut mieux se faire profil bas pour ne pas attirer l’attention. 


> Do not be held a cheat, even though it is impossible to live today without being one. Let your greatest cunning lie in covering up what looks like cunning,

#### Tips:
Most people are open books. 
They say what they feel, blurt out their opinions at every opportunity, and constandy reveal their plans and intentions. They do this for several reasons. 

First, it is easy and natural to always want to talk about one's feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control your tongue and monitor what you reveal. 

Second, many believe mat by being honest and open they are winning people's hearts and showing their good nature.

==They are greatly deluded==. 
> Honesty is actually a blunt instrument, which bloodies more than it cuts.

Y**our honesty is likely to offend people**; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly trum of what you feel or think.

###### Tactic
A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments. (*Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.*) 
Most people will believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to play so lightly with something as emotional as one's opinions and values. 


The same applies for any decoyed object of desire: 
- Seem to want something in which you are actually not at all interested 
- and your enemies will be thrown off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculations.

Use this tactic in the following manner:
- Hide your intentions not by closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspicious)
	- but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals just not your real ones!
- You will kill three birds with one stone: 
	- You appear friendly, open, and trusting; 
	- you conceal your intentions; 
	- and you send your rivals on time-consuming wild-goose chases.


> If you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in the art of concealing your intentions. 
> 1st instinct is to trust apparence. 


Another powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false sincerity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remembertheir first instinct is to trust appearances, and since they value honesty and want to believe in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or see through your act. Seeming to believe what you say gives your words great weight. 
- *This is how Iago deceived and destroyed Othello: Given the depth of his emotions, the apparent sincerity of his concerns about Desdemona's supposed infidelity, how could Othello distrust him.*

To make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing your intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrightness as important social values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thoughtthough only one that is actually meaningless or irrelevant, of course. 
- *Napoleon's minister Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing some apparent secret. This feigned confidencea decoy would then elicit a real confidence on the other person's part.*

Remember: The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise their dishonesty in omers. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal of weapons.

#### Pour quoi "smoke screen" : 
Afficher vos prétentions attisera la jalousie.
Car la jolousie risque d'attirer: 
- des enemis émotionelle (*pensé a la dissolution du cercle des con artiste américain*)
- de liguera tout un tas de personne 
	- *amis, enemis, competiteur, suppérieur ...*

### PART I: USE DECOYED OBJECTS OF DESIRE AND RED HERRINGS TO THROW PEOPLE OFF THE SCENT

If at any point in the deception you practice people have the slightest suspicion as to your intentions, all is lost. Do not give them the chance to sense what you are up to: Throw them off the scent by dragging red herrings across the path. Use false sincerity, send ambiguous signals, set up misleading objects of desire. Unable to distinguish the genuine from the false, they cannot pick out your real goal.

### PART II: USE SMOKE SCREENS TO DISGUISE YOUR ACTIONS

Deception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a screen of smoke to distract people's attention from your real purpose. The bland exteriorlike the unreadable poker faceis often the perfect smoke screen, hiding your intentions behind the comfortable and familiar. If you lead the sucker down a familiar path, he won't catch on when you lead him into a trap.

Another effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a series of actions that seduce die victim into believing you will continue in die same way. The pattern plays on the psychology of anticipation: Our behavior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.


-> histoire du massacre des Ba'al avec le challenge de Dieu et leur Dieu par Jehu.

Learn from the Yellow Kid: The familiar, inconspicuous front is the perfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea diat seems ordinary enougha business deal, financial intrigue. The sucker's mind is distracted, his suspicions allayed. 
That is when you gentiy guide him onto the second path, die slippery slope down which he slides helplessly into your trap.

-> Histoire de Selassie.
Remember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive. Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their view in anodier, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that implies the other person's superioritythese are perfect diversionary devices.

Properly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It enabled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single bullet.

IF you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with elaborate lies and tall tales, you are greatly mistaken. The best deceivers utilize a bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themselves. They know that extravagant words and gestures immediately raise suspicion. Instead, they envelop their mark in the familiar, the banal, the harmless.


The simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind a bland, unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection. This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to perfect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt's face. 


Henry Kissinger would bore his opponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice, his blank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed over, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off-guard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it, “While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he practices a bland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and confuses opponents, permits greater concentration.”

An adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a number of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and misdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture. People want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuine, for the belief is pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be.
See:
[be royal] 
[disarm with honesty]

Another psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke screen is the tendency to mistake appearances for realitythe feeling that if someone seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be real. 
This habit makes the seamless blend a very effective front. 
The trick is simple: 
- You simply blend in with those around you. 
- The better you blend, the less suspicious you become.

[Blending] in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the better you can conceal your intentions.

Remember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors, to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at having to wear such a bland maskit is often your unreadability that draws people to you and makes you appear a person of power.

A sheep never marauds, a sheep never deceives, a sheep is magnificently dumb and docile. With a sheepskin on his back, a fox can pass right into the chicken coop.

###### Authority: 
Have you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends to surprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy Conceal your purpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your designs until they cannot be opposed, until the combat is over. Win the victory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those warlike people whose designs are not known except by the ravaged country through which they have passed. (Ninon de Lenclos, 1623-1706)

###### Reversal
No smoke screen, red herring, false sincerity, or any other diversionary device will succeed in concealing your intentions if you already have an established reputation for deception. And as you get older and achieve success, it often becomes increasingly difficult to disguise your cunning. Everyone knows you practice deception; persist in playing naive and you run the risk of seeming die rankest hypocrite, which will severely limit your room to maneuver. In such cases it is better to own up, to appear the honest rogue, or, better, the repentant rogue. Not only will you be admired for your frankness, but, most wonderful and strange of all, you will be able to continue your stratagems.

As P. T. Barnum, the nineteentii-century king of humbuggery, grew older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver. At one point he organized a buffalo hunt in New Jersey, complete witii Indians and a few imported buffalo. He publicized die hunt as genuine, but it came off as so completely fake that die crowd, instead of getting angry and asking for their money back, was gready amused. They knew Barnum pulled tricks all the time; diat was the secret of his success, and they loved him for it. Learning a lesson from this affair, Barnum stopped concealing all of his devices, even revealing his deceptions in a tell-all autobiography. As Kierkegaard wrote, “The world wants to be deceived.”

Finally, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purposes by presenting a bland, familiar exterior, diere are times when die colorful, conspicuous gesture is die right diversionary tactic. The great charlatan mountebanks of seventeendi- and eighteenth-century Europe used humor and entertainment to deceive their audiences. Dazzled by a great show, the public would not notice the charlatans' real intentions. Thus the star charlatan himself would appear in town in a night-black coach drawn by black horses. Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star entertainers would accompany him, pulling people in to his demonstrations of elixirs and quack potions. The charlatan made entertainment seem like die business of die day; the business of die day was actually die sale of the elixirs and quack potions.

Spectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to conceal your intentions, but diey cannot be used indefinitely. The public grows tired and suspicious, and eventually catches on to die trick. And indeed die charlatans had to move quickly from town to town, before word spread tiiat die potions were useless and die entertainment a trick. Powerful people with bland exteriors, on the odier handdie Talleyrands, die Rotii-schilds, die Selassiescan practice tiieir deceptions in die same place tiiroughout their lifetimes. Their act never wears thin, and rarely causes suspicion. The colorful smoke screen should be used cautiously, then, and only when die occasion is right.
