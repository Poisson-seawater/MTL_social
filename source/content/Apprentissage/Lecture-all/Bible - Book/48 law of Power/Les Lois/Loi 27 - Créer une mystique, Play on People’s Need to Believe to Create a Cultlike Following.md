# Loi 27 : Créer une mystique: Play on People’s Need to Believe to Create a Cultlike Following
###### intro
People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold power.


###### Corps
Devenez l’épicentre de ce désir en leur offrant une cause à soutenir, une nouvelle foi à suivre. Vos paroles doivent être vagues mais pleines de promesses ; mettez l’accent sur l’enthousiasme plutôt que sur la rationalité.
Les êtres humains ont un besoin  irrésistible de croire en quelque chose. 

Il s’agit donc de développer un système de croyance ou une cause à soutenir qui rassemblent. Cinq conseils pour réussir l’exercice :
- étape 1 : Rester vague et simpliste
- étape 2 : Faire appel aux sens plus qu’à l’intellect
- étape 3 : Singer les structures religieuses
- étape 4 : Ne pas révéler ses sources de revenus
- étape 5 : Désigner un ennemi

Donnez à vos disciples des rituels à accomplir, demandez-leur des sacrifices. En l’absence d’une religion organisée et de grande cause, votre nouveau système de croyance vous apportera un inestimable pouvoir.

## THE SCIENCE OF CHARLATANISM, OR HOW TO CREATE A CULT IN FIVE EASY STEPS
As humans, we have a desperate need to believe in something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptiness that comes from a lack of something to believe in. Dangle in front of us some new cause, elixir, get-rich-quick scheme, or the latest technological trend or art movement and we leap from the water as one to take the bait.  -> look at History

###### Step 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple.
To create a cult you must first attract attention. This you should do not through actions, which are too clear and readable, but through words, which are hazy and deceptive. 

Your initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must include two elements: 
1. on the one hand the promise of somediing great and transformative, 
2. and on the other a total vagueness. 

This combination will stimulate all kinds of hazy dreams in your listeners, who will make their own connections and see what they want to see.

To make your vagueness attractive, use words of great resonance but cloudy meaning, words full of heat and enthusiasm. Fancy tides for simple things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of new words for vague concepts. All of these create the impression of specialized knowledge, giving you a veneer of profundity. 

Talk too vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more dangerous to be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people will gain by following your cult, you will be expected to satisfy them.

Most people's problems have complex causes: deep-rooted neurosis, interconnected social factors, roots that go way back in time and are exceedingly hard to unravel. Few, however, have the patience to deal with this; most people want to hear that a simple solution will cure their problem.


###### Step 2: Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the Intellectual.

Once people have begun to gadier around you, two dangers will present themselves: boredom and skepticism.
- Boredom will make people go elsewhere; 
- skepticism will allow them the distance to think rationally about whatever it is you are offering, blowing away the mist you have artfully created and revealing your ideas for what they are. 

You need to amuse the bored, then, and ward off the cynics.
Use theatre of device of it kind. 
Use all 5 senses !!
Use the exotic - distant culture, strange custom - theatric effect. Make extradinary the banal and ordinary affair.


###### Step 3: Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the Group.
Your cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it. Find a way both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have long held unquestioned authority for large numbers of people, and continue to do so in our supposedly secular age. 
And even if the religion itself has faded some, its forms still resonate with power. The lofty and holy associations of organized religion can be endlessly exploited.

Create rituals for your followers; organize them into a hierarchy, ranking them in grades of sanctity, and giving them names and titles that resound with religious overtones; ask them for sacrifices that will fill your coffers and increase your power. 
To emphasize your gadiering's quasi-religious nature, talk and act like a prophet. You are not a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman, or any other word that hides your real power in the mist of religion.

###### Step 4: Disguise Your Source of Income.
Your group has grown, and you have structured it in a churchlike form. Your coffers are beginning to fill wim your followers' money. 
Yet you must never be seen as hungry for money and the power it brings. It is at this moment that you must disguise the source of your income.

Your followers want to believe that if they follow you all sorts of good things will fall into dieir lap. 
By surrounding yourself widi luxury you become living proof of the soundness of your belief system. Never reveal that your wealth actually comes from your followers' pockets; instead, make it seem to come from the truth of your mediods. 
Followers will copy your each and every move in the belief that it will bring them the same results, and their imitative enthusiasm will blind them to the charlatan nature of your wealth.

###### Step 5: Set Up an Us-Versus-Them Dynamic. 
The group is now large and diriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. 
If you are not careful, though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will demagnetize the group. To keep your followers united, you must now do what all religions and belief systems have done: create an us-versus-them dynamic. 

First, make sure your followers believe they are part of an exclusive club, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengthen this bond, manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any outsider who tries to reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system can now be described as a member of this devious force.

If you have no enemies, invent one. 
Given a straw man to react against, your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause to believe in and infidels to destroy.




## autre
The lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt, the distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a group. 
The warmth and infectiousness of the group overwhelm the skeptical individual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult. Also, by playing on people's repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited feelings for signs of your mystical strength. You gain untold power by working on people's unrealized desire for a kind of promiscuous and pagan unity.

Remember too that the most effective cults mix religion with science. Take the latest technological trend or fad and blend it with a noble cause, a mystical faith, a new form of healing. People's interpretations of your hybrid cult will run rampant, and they will attribute powers to you that you had never even thought to claim.

Remember: People are not interested in the truth about change. They do not want to hear that it has come from hard work, or from anything as banal as exhaustion, boredom, or depression; they are dying to believe in something romantic, otherworldly. 
They want to hear of angels and out-of-body experiences. Indulge them. Hint at the mystical source of some personal change, wrap it in ethereal colors, and a cuklike following will form around you. Adapt to people's needs: The messiah must mirror the desires of his followers. And always aim high. The bigger and bolder your illusion, the better !!

###### The case of the Mountain Doctor 
It teaches us valuable lessons in the creation of a cultlike following. 

First, you must find a way to engage people's will, to make their belief in your powers strong enough that they imagine all sorts of benefits. Their belief will have a self-fulfilling quality, but you must make sure that it is you, rather than their own will, who is seen as the agent of transformation. Find the belief, cause, or fantasy that will make them believe with a passion and they will imagine the rest, worshipping you as healer, prophet, genius, whatever you like.

Second, Schiippach teaches us the everlasting power of belief in nature, and in simplicity. Nature, in reality, is full of much that is terrifying poisonous plants, fierce animals, sudden disasters, plagues. Belief in the healing, comforting quality of nature is really a constructed myth, a romanticism. 

But the appeal to nature can bring you great power, especially in complicated and stressful times.
This appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of theater of nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the qualities that fit the romanticism of the times
He did not make himself one with nature; instead he molded nature into a cult, an artificial construction.
To create a “natural” effect you actually have to work hard, making nature theatrical and delightfully pagan. Otherwise no one will notice. Nature too must follow trends and be progressive.

##### Pourquoi "devenir un maître à penser"
Objectif : annihiler le sens critique de votre entourage pour mieux le manipuler.
###### Image: The Magnet. 
An unseen force draws objects to it, which in turn become magnetized themselves, drawing other pieces to them, the magnetic power of toe whole constantly increasing. But take away the original magnet and it all falls apart. Become the magnet, the invisible force that attracts people's imaginations and holds them together. Once they have clustered around you, no power can wrest them away.

###### Authority: 
The charlatan achieves his great power by simply opening a possibility for men to believe what they already want to believe. . . . The credulous cannot keep at a distance; they crowd around the wonder worker, entering his personal aura, surrendering themselves to illusion with a heavy solemnity, like cattle. (Grete de Francesco)

###### Reversal
One reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive than an individual, and turns over to you that much more power. This comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived soul but an angry crowd that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed you. The charlatans constantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as it inevitably became clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas were sham. Too slow and they paid with their lives. In playing with the crowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out for any sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you. When you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to adapt, attuning yourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that a group will produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep your bags packed.

For this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by one. Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect as putting them in a groupit makes them more prone to suggestion and intimidation. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may prove easier to escape than a crowd.
