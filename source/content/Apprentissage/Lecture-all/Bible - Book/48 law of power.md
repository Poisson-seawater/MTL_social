# Interpretation and though during 1st reading:
Silence, the less you speak the less you reveal, the more people will talk and may  say foulish think to get some interpretation of you. 
Act as Louis XIV, no word and poker face. 
When talk, use short sentence and sphinx like. 

If need to talk, talk about stuff you heard /learn and ask the other his opinion. And let him talk => enter the how to make the conversation go deep about him/her. 

Parler peut aussi être utile pour paraître not a treat. Dans se cas être comme le fou du roi et juste dire des choses non utilisable ou smoke screen / red herring.
