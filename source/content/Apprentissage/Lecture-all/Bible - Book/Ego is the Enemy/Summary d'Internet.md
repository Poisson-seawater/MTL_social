#### Ego Is the Enemy Book Summary
- “The orator Demosthenes once said that virtue begins with understanding and is fulfilled by courage.”

- “The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition.”

- “With every ambition and goal we have—big or small—ego is there undermining us on the very journey we’ve put everything into pursuing.”

-   “Just one thing keeps ego around—comfort.”

-   “At any given time in life, people find themselves at one of three stages. 
	- We’re aspiring to something—trying to make a dent in the universe. 
	- We have achieved success—perhaps a little, perhaps a lot. 
	- Or we have failed—recently or continually.”


-   “Your ego is not some power you’re forced to satiate at every turn. It can be managed. It can be directed.”

-   “When we remove ego, we’re left with what is real.”

-   “You must practice seeing yourself with a little distance, cultivating the ability to get out of your own head.”

-   “What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness.”

-   “For your work to have truth in it, it must come from truth. If you want to be more than a flash in the pan, you must be prepared to focus on the long term.”

-   “We will learn that though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek. Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative—one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time.”

-   “So what is scarce and rare? Silence. The ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsist without its validation. Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong.”

-   “Talk depletes us. ==Talking and doing fight for the same resources.== Research shows that while goal visualization is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. The same goes for verbalization.”
	- “The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other.”

-   “If your purpose is something larger than you—to accomplish something, to prove something to yourself—then suddenly everything becomes both easier and more difficult. 
	- Easier in the sense that you know now what it is you need to do and what is important to you. 
		- The other “choices” wash away, as they aren’t really choices at all. They’re distractions. It’s about the doing, not the recognition. 
		- Easier in the sense that you don’t need to compromise. 
	- Harder because each opportunity—no matter how gratifying or rewarding—must be evaluated along strict guidelines: 
		- Does this help me do what I have set out to do? 
		- Does this allow me to do what I need to do? 
		- Am I being selfish or selfless?”

-   “In this course, it is not “Who do I want to be in life?” but “What is it that I want to accomplish in life?” 
	- Setting aside selfish interest, it asks: 
		- What calling does it serve? 
		- What principles govern my choices? 
		- Do I want to be like everyone else or do I want to do something different?”

-   “Although it’s never too late, the earlier you ask yourself these questions the better.”

-   “The mixed martial arts pioneer and multi-title champion Frank Shamrock has a system he trains fighters in that he calls plus, minus, and equal. Each fighter, to become great, he said, needs to have someone better that they can learn from, someone lesser who they can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge themselves against.”
	- “The purpose of Shamrock’s formula is simple: to get real and continuous feedback about what they know and what they don’t know from every angle. It purges out the ego that puffs us up, the fear that makes us doubt ourselves, and any laziness that might make us want to coast.”
	- “As Shamrock observed, ‘False ideas about yourself destroy you. For me, I always stay a student. That’s what martial arts are about, and you have to use that humility as a tool. You put yourself beneath someone you trust.’”

-   “This begins by accepting that others know more than you and that you can benefit from their knowledge, and then seeking them out and knocking down the illusions you have about yourself.”

-   “A true student is like a sponge. Absorbing what goes on around him, filtering it, latching on to what he can hold. A student is self-critical and self-motivated, always trying to improve his understanding so that he can move on to the next topic, the next challenge. A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic. There is no room for ego there.”

-   “Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment. Because just as often, we fail with—no, because of—passion.”

-   “I’m talking about passion of a different sort—unbridled enthusiasm, our willingness to pounce on what’s in front of us with the full measure of our zeal, the ‘bundle of energy’ that our teachers and gurus have assured us is our most important asset.”

-   “It is that burning, unquenchable desire to start or to achieve some vague, ambitious, and distant goal. This seemingly innocuous motivation is so far from the right track it hurts.”

-   “Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.”

-   “What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective.”

-   “Passion is form over function. Purpose is function, function, function.”

-   “The critical work that you want to do will require your deliberation and consideration. Not passion. Not naïveté.”

-   “It’d be far better if you were intimidated by what lies ahead—humbled by its magnitude and determined to see it through regardless. Leave passion for the amateurs. Make it about what you feel you must do and say, not what you care about and wish to be.”

-   “When you want to do something—something big and important and meaningful—you will be subjected to treatment ranging from indifference to outright sabotage. Count on it.”

-   “Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind.”

-   “The question to ask, when you feel pride, then, is this: What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see? What am I avoiding, or running from, with my bluster, franticness, and embellishments? It is far better to ask and answer these questions now, with the stakes still low, than it will be later.”

-   “It’s worth saying: just because you are quiet doesn’t mean that you are without pride. Privately thinking you’re better than others is still pride. It’s still dangerous.”

-   “Make it so you don’t have to fake it—that’s they key.”

-   “Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this. I am passing the marshmallow test. I am earning what my ambition burns for. I am making an investment in myself instead of in my ego. Give yourself a little credit for this choice, but not so much, because you’ve got to get back to the task at hand: practicing, working, improving.”

-   “It is not enough only to be a student at the beginning. It is a position that one has to assume for life. Learn from everyone and everything. From the people you beat, and the people who beat you, from the people you dislike, even from your supposed enemies. At every step and every juncture in life, there is the opportunity to learn—and even if the lesson is purely remedial, we must not let ego block us from hearing it again.”

-   “Pick up a book on a topic you know next to nothing about. Put yourself in rooms where you’re the least knowledgeable person. That uncomfortable feeling, that defensiveness that you feel when your most deeply held assumptions are challenged—what about subjecting yourself to it deliberately? Change your mind. Change your surroundings.”

-   “We want so desperately to believe that those who have great empires set out to build one. Why? So we can indulge in the pleasurable planning of ours. So we can take full credit for the good that happens and the riches and respect that come our way. Narrative is when you look back at an improbable or unlikely path to your success and say: I knew it all along. Instead of: I hoped. I worked. I got some good breaks. Or even: I thought this could happen. Of course you didn’t really know all along—or if you did, it was more faith than knowledge. But who wants to remember all the times you doubted yourself?”

-   “Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance. It turns our life into a story—and turns us into caricatures—while we still have to live it.”

-   “These narratives don’t change the past, but they do have the power to negatively impact our future.”

-   “When we are aspiring we must resist the impulse to reverse engineer success from other people’s stories. When we achieve our own, we must resist the desire to pretend that everything unfolded exactly as we’d planned. There was no grand narrative. You should remember—you were there when it happened.”

-   “Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence. We must shun the false crown and continue working on what got us here.”

-   “It’s not about beating the other guy. It’s not about having more than the others. It’s about being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It’s about going where you set out to go. About accomplishing the most that you’re capable of in what you choose. That’s it. No more and no less.”

-   “As you become successful in your own field, your responsibilities may begin to change. Days become less and less about doing and more and more about making decisions. Such is the nature of leadership. This transition requires reevaluating and updating your identity. It requires a certain humility to put aside some of the more enjoyable or satisfying parts of your previous job. It means accepting that others might be more qualified or specialized in areas in which you considered yourself competent—or at least their time is better spent on them than yours.”

-   “Ego needs honors in order to be validated. Confidence, on the other hand, is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition.”

-   “We have to fight to stay sober, despite the many different forces swirling around our ego.”

-   “According to Robert Greene, there are two types of time in our lives: 
	- dead time, when people are passive and waiting, 
	- and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utilizing every second. 
	- Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.”

-   “When success begins to slip from your fingers—for whatever reason—the response isn’t to grip and claw so hard that you shatter it to pieces. It’s to understand that you must work yourself back to the aspirational phase. You must get back to first principles and best practices.”

-   “The only real failure is abandoning your principles. Killing what you love because you can’t bear to part from it is selfish and stupid. If your reputation can’t absorb a few blows, it wasn’t worth anything in the first place.”


## 2nd resum
### 1. Live with Purpose Not Passion

Having purpose will help you accomplish life changing work. Holiday says the first thing you need to do is ask yourself, “why do I do what I do?” If you don’t have an answer to this question, you should [take some time to figure it out](https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2014/10/why-do-you-do-what-you-do-because-you-better-know/).

Most people aren’t living on purpose. They wander around life distracted, looking for the next form of gratification, wondering why they aren’t happy and why they don’t get what they want. They drive to a job they hate to pay for a car that brings them to that job, which also pays for a house they abandon during the day to go to that job. The ego loves the comfort a “secure” job has, but purpose, as well as the best things, happen outside of your comfort zone.

On the other hand, many harmonious and effective people have found that answering the following questions helped them live with purpose: Why do I do what I do? Who am I? What purpose am I serving?

Once one chooses to [pursue the critical work over ego](https://dailystoic.com/emily-esfahani-smith/), how does one determine what that work is? [Bill Walsh](https://dailystoic.com/michael-lombardi-interview/), the coach who took the 49ers from being the worst team in the NFL to the Super Bowl, is a great example of someone picking the critical work. He did not focus on some vague notion of “winning.” He knew that focusing on the basics and perfecting those would lead to success. He could change what the team was doing and how effectively they were working, but he could not put on a definitive timeline when the next win would happen. He was attached to effort [(the part that could be controlled)](https://dailystoic.com/control-and-choice/) not outcomes [(which were out of his control)](https://dailystoic.com/happy-stoic/). His standards were simple and ground level changes rather than fantastic visions, but by implementing them, as the saying goes, “the score takes care of itself.” [Hall of Fame college basketball coach John Wooden](https://dailystoic.com/ego/) also had a similar perspective as he led his team to winning ten basketball championships in twelve years. These coaches had [clarity, discipline & patience](https://dailystoic.com/through-discipline-we-can-achieve-serenity/) in their ascent to mastery. They knew their purpose and their work brought them joy.

The Greeks used the word [_Euthymia_](https://dailystoic.com/trust-yourself/) for this which is a sense of our own path and how we can stay on it without getting distracted. Prioritize your goals with clarity and then follow through. True confidence comes from putting in the time; it comes from discipline and mastery. One important point to note is that [critical work is not helped by passion](https://dailystoic.com/passion-is-not-a-good-thing/). It requires deliberation, not blind emotion, otherwise it is subject to the delusions of ego. Divorced from reality, an endeavor cannot succeed. [People who are passionate](https://dailystoic.com/remember-its-all-ephemeral/) will tell you all the things they are going to do, but they can never show you any progress, because there usually isn’t any. They talk a lot, but get little done. People who are driven by purpose don’t need to talk about their work because you will see the results. It’s okay to be passionate, but be passionate with discipline. Execute with excellence. [Remain humble](https://dailystoic.com/humility-kills-pride/); know that you always have more to learn:

> **_“The critical work that you want to do will require your deliberation and consideration. Leave passion for the amateurs. Make it about what you feel you must do and say, not what you care about and wish to be.”_**

Get to know your ego, but once you make the choice to manage your ego and pursue your purpose, be prepared for when people try to sabotage you. An illustration the book uses is of Jackie Robinson, who showed [incredible restraint](https://dailystoic.com/stoic-response-power/) in the face of adversity. As the first African American to play Major League Baseball, fans, coaches and other players were openly racist to him as he was on the field and batting. If Robinson would have reacted to these injustices with his ego, he would not have had the impact he is still having today; [he was driven by a higher purpose](https://dailystoic.com/stoicism-nature/).

[Our adversities](https://dailystoic.com/courage-adversity-modesty-success/) likely pale in comparison to Jackie Robinson’s, but the only thing we can be sure of when we are embarking on an endeavor is that there will be adversity and we will very likely be treated poorly. In these situations, there are two things to remember: 1) [It degrades](https://dailystoic.com/accept-the-haters-as-they-are/) [others, not you, when they treat you poorly and unfairly](https://dailystoic.com/accept-the-haters-as-they-are/), and 2) [Choose alive time over dead](https://dailystoic.com/think-time-kill/) [time.](https://dailystoic.com/think-time-kill/)

The second point requires further elaboration. [Malcolm X](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-change-your-life/) went to jail for years. While there, [he read voraciously](https://dailystoic.com/stoic-reading-list/), and left a much more educated man than when he had entered. He couldn’t do much about his circumstances, [but he did choose what to do while he was in those circumstances](https://dailystoic.com/stoic-response-rejection/). Many people go to prison, but some take the time to learn from their mistakes and change their lives when they leave, and others end up back in prison not long after.

Alive time is time when you are actively using your time usefully and improving; dead time is time you spend passive. We may not always be able to choose our circumstances, but we can always choose whether we want to make our time alive time or dead time. [Viktor Frankl](https://dailystoic.com/viktor-frankl-50-cent-mother-taught-death/) was able to refine his theories of meaning and suffering from Nazi concentration camps. Francis Scott Key wrote what would become the national anthem of the United States while a [prisoner of war.](https://dailystoic.com/prisoner-at-war/) The question the book leaves hanging:

> **_“…this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it?”_**

###    2. **Always Be a Student**

The [greatest leaders](https://dailystoic.com/leaders-eat-last/) and wisest thinkers have all been students of life. They possessed a [unique curiosity](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/10/18/the-daily-stoic-ryan-holiday/) about life and had the discipline to constantly be learning. Many people get overly confident in one area and forget that they know so little about everything else. The ego tries to build an identification with success, withholding you from learning more, but learning is a requirement, especially in the beginning. The book explains that when you are just starting out you need to remember: You aren’t as good as you think you are, you probably need your attitude readjusted, and the things you learned in books or school are out of date or wrong.

Many factors will determine the success you will reach as you’re starting out, one of them being [your willingness to listen to feedback, especially critical feedback](https://dailystoic.com/first-tool-of-the-stoic/). The book discusses an amateur as being defensive to critical feedback, but a professional as delighted in being challenged to learn more. It illustrates the idea of a real professional with Kirk Hammett, lead guitarists of the heavy metal band Metallica. After Metallica recruited him he quickly found a teacher so that he could become even better. Metallica went on to become one of the most successful bands in the world, and throughout all this success, Kirk remained humble and continued learning. According to the book, If you’re not still learning, you’re already dying.”

Hammett demonstrated the qualities of a true student:

> **“A true student is like a sponge. Absorbing what goes on around him, filtering it, latching on to what he can hold. A student is self-critical and self-motivated, always trying to improve his understanding so that he can move on to the next topic, the next challenge. A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic. There is no room for ego there.”**

To become the best you can be, and to maintain that greatness you need to have a student mindset. You need to always be learning. [Everything in life has something to teach you](https://dailystoic.com/ego/), but ego gets in the way of opportunities you have had or will have. The ego tells you that you shouldn’t do an internship because you are overqualified for it. The ego doesn’t want to do the grunt work because it thinks it’s too good for that. People living with purpose look past this, and they focus on what is important, believing in what they need to do. Appreciate the opportunity. Take the internship. Put in the time and effort, and learn. Think long-term, this investment will pay dividends in the future, the book explains:

> **_“Humility is what keeps us there, concerned we don’t know enough and that we must continue to study. Ego rushes to the end, rationalizes that patience is for losers (wrongly seeing it as a weakness), and assumes we’re good enough to give our talents a go in the world.”_**

Humility can be gained by [thinking about that bigger picture of life](https://dailystoic.com/the-taxes-of-life/). Think about the vastness of the universe, multiple galaxies around us, and think about how small you are. Know that you are also connected to this vast universe, and your purpose is more likely to emerge. Looking into the sky at night can help with this, as well as thinking about all the people and events that came before you and all that is to come after. Purpose seems to easily flow within those who take time to focus on the bigger picture.

The stoics used the word [sympatheia](https://dailystoic.com/secret-singular-philosophy-todays-politics-desperately-missing/) for this state of mind, which means “a connectedness with the cosmos.” This connection makes you ask yourself: [Who am I? What am I doing and why?](https://dailystoic.com/secret-singular-philosophy-todays-politics-desperately-missing/) The book elaborates on how material success can take you away from this perspective. Don’t let your ego convince you the world revolves around you. Intentionally seek out the cosmos and your purpose will be revealed to you over time, which is also a part of the [stoic view](https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/): **_“Purpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.”_**

Find and follow your purpose, and then do the work. The book explains that you should make it so you don’t have to fake it: **_“Can you imagine a doctor trying to get by with anything less? Or a quarterback? So why would you try otherwise?”_**

Be a lifelong student even after—_especially_ after, your major accomplishments. Eliminate what isn’t necessary. Stay open-minded. Set goals and live on purpose.

###    3. **Talk & think less; do more**

When you begin to live with purpose instead of passion your ego will begin to lessen, and you will gain the quiet confidence the philosopher Seneca referred to as _Euthymia_: having a sense of your own path and not getting distracted by externals. As you talk less and act more you will begin to gain this tranquility when working, helping you maintain your purposeful work:

> **_“You know that all things require work and that work might be quite difficult. But do you really understand? Do you have any idea just how much work there is going to be? Not work until you get your big break, not work until you make a name for yourself, but work, work, work, forever and ever.”_**

Talking is easy, everyone does it, but silence is rare in today’s world. Your ego tells you that you need recognition from others, but real confidence doesn’t need to talk, [it produces work](https://dailystoic.com/it-works-if-you-work-it/). Talking destroys action. Sit quietly and work. Let go of the distractions of social media and of the news, and focus on your work. Watch how much better you get:

> **_“They work quietly in the corner. They turn their inner turmoil into product—and eventually into stillness. They ignore the impulse to seek recognition before they act. They don’t talk too much. And they don’t mind the feeling that others, out there in public are enjoying the limelight, are somewhat getting the better end of the deal (They are not).”_**

[Talking and thinking too much drain the energy](https://dailystoic.com/stop-chattering-about-other-people/) you could be using to put into your work. At times we definitely need to be thinking, such as when envisioning goals, but if you spend too much time thinking and talking about what you are going to do, you are less likely to actually do it. Where are the results? Stay focused on execution. Think when you need to and then get to work. [People who live with purpose](https://dailystoic.com/emily-esfahani-smith/) understand they aren’t working to retire and live on their couch. They are working for something beyond themselves, and this guides them confidently throughout their lives:

> **_“When facing a new task, do you seek to talk about it or do you face the struggle head on?”_**

Thinking too much can also lead you into living with a psychological term marked as “imaginary audience,” which is explained in the book. Many adolescents go through this and many adults hold on to it. It’s the idea that people are watching and thinking about you when they are not. It’s the teenager who misses a week of class because they are so embarrassed of spilling juice on their pants and think that everyone in the school is talking about it. They are not. This is the imaginary audience. People don’t think about you as much as you think they do, which is a relief. Most people are so consumed in their own lives, so take time to rationalize your thoughts and get back to work. The ego loves the imaginary audience and thrives on it, so remember the bigger picture, let go of your wandering thoughts and bring yourself into the present moment:

> **_“Living clearly and present takes courage. Don’t live in the haze of the abstract, live with the tangible and real, even if—especially if—it’s uncomfortable. Be part of what’s going on around you. Feast on it, adjust for it.”_**

**_***_**

In short, the book says we must manage our ego or see it get the best of us. Think of coach Bill Walsh who focused on perfecting the basics, taking the worst team in the NFL to winning the Super Bowl. Be an eternal student, like Metallica’s Kirk Hammett, absorbing everything around you like a sponge, knowing that there is always more to learn. As well as living with purpose and remaining a student, focus on doing the work instead of seeking recognition, letting your confidence show with results.

[Practicing stoicism](https://ryanholiday.net/a-stoic-guide-to-navigating-the-modern-workplace/) can escalate your implementation of the lessons within each theme. Now go out and accomplish the life changing work you are meant to do.

### **10 Best Quotes from Ego Is The Enemy**

> _“Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room—until you change that with results.”_

> _“You can lie to yourself, saying that you put in the time, or pretend that you’re working, but_ _eventually someone will show up. You’ll be tested. And quite possibly, found out.”_

> _“In this course, it is not ‘Who do I want to be in life’ But ‘What is it that I want to accomplish in life?’ Setting aside selfish interest, it asks: What calling does it serve? What principles govern my choices? Do I want to be like everyone else or do I want to do something different?”_

> _“And what is most obvious but most ignored is that perfecting the personal regularly leads to success as a professional, but rarely the other way around.”_

> _“Most trouble is temporary…unless you make that not so.”_

> _“Work is finding yourself alone at the track when the weather kept everyone else indoors. It’s pushing through the pain and crappy first drafts and prototypes. It is ignoring whatever plaudits others are getting, and more importantly, ignoring whatever plaudits you may be getting. Because there is work to be done. Work doesn’t want to be good. It is made so, despite the headwind.”_

> _“Most successful people are people you’ve never heard of. They want it that way. It keeps them sober. It helps them do their jobs.”_

> _“Remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to one-up those around you. Go and put yourself in touch with the infinite, and end your conscious separation from the world. Reconcile yourself a bit better with the realities of life. Realize how much came before you, and how only wisps of it remain.”_

> _“What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness.”_

> _“Your ego screams for people to acknowledge you. But you must do nothing. Take it. Eat it until you’re sick. Endure it. Quietly brush it off and work harder. Play the game. Ignore the noise; for the love of God, do not let it distract you.”_



## d
Ego is the enemy of **building**, of **maintaining**, and of **recovering**.

Your ego is not some power you’re forced to satiate at every turn. It can be managed. It can be **directed**.

### **Part I: Aspire**
Talent is only the starting point. The question is: Will you be able to make the most of it? Or will you be your own worst enemy?

Practice seeing yourself with a little distance. Cultivate the ability to get out of your own head. Detachment is a sort of natural ego antidote.

Though we think big, we must **act** and **live** **small** to achieve what we seek.

We seem to think that silence is a sign of weakness. But **silence is strength**—particularly early on in any journey.

The greatest work and art comes from wrestling with the void, facing it instead of scrambling to make it go away.

It is not _“Who do I want to be in life?”_ but _“What is it that I want to accomplish in life?”_

You can’t learn if you think you already know.

Ego gives us wicked feedback, disconnected from reality. It blocks us from improving by telling us that we don’t need to improve.

How can someone be busy and not accomplish anything? Well, that’s the passion paradox.

What we need is purpose—**passion with boundaries**.

Purpose is about pursuing something **outside yourself** as opposed to pleasuring yourself.

Attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful. **Subsume your identity** into theirs and move both forward simultaneously.

Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room—until you change that with **results**. Be lesser, do more.

**Help yourself by helping others.** Make a concerted effort to trade your short-term gratification for a longer-term payoff.

We must prepare for pride and kill it early—or it will kill what we aspire to.

What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see? What am I avoiding, or running from?

_“You can’t build a reputation on what you’re going to do.”_—Henry Ford.

There is no end zone. To think of a number is to live in a conditional future. We’re simply talking about a lot of hours—that to get where we want to go isn’t about brilliance, but **continual effort**.

Where we decide to put our energy decides what we’ll ultimately accomplish.

Work doesn’t want to be good. It is made so, despite the headwind.

### **Part II:** **Success**

As success arrives, ego begins to toy with our minds and weaken the will that made us win in the first place.

Without the right **values**, success is brief.

No matter what you’ve done up to this point, you better still be a student. If you’re not still learning, you’re already dying. It is not enough only to be a student at the beginning. It is a position that one has to assume for life.

An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning to be enjoyable. They like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and **endless process**.

Crafting stories out of past events is dangerous and untrue. Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance. These narratives don’t change the past, but they do have the power to negatively impact our future.

Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the **execution**—and on executing with excellence.

Far too often, we look at other people and make their approval the standard we feel compelled to meet, and as a result, squander our very potential and purpose.

With success, particularly power, come some of the greatest and most dangerous delusions: **entitlement**, **control**, and **paranoia**.

As you become successful in your own field, your days will be less about doing and more about **making decisions**. This transition requires reevaluating and updating your identity.

Creativity is a matter of receptiveness and recognition. This cannot happen if you’re convinced the world revolves around you. By removing the ego—even temporarily—we can access what’s left standing in relief. By widening our perspective, more comes into view.

**Sobriety** is the counterweight that must balance out success. Especially if things keep getting better and better.

### **Part III:** **Failure**

Failure always arrives uninvited, but through our ego, far too many of us allow it to stick around.

What matters is that we can **respond** to what life throws at us. And how we make it through.

The less **attached** we are to outcomes the better. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the **effort**—not the results, good or bad—is enough.

Do your work. Do it well. Then “let go and let God.” Recognition and rewards—those are extra.

The world is to what we “want.” If we persist in wanting, we are simply setting ourselves up for resentment or worse. **Doing the work is enough.**

Hitting bottom is as brutal as it sounds. But the feeling after—it is one of the most powerful perspectives in the world.

Most trouble is temporary, unless you make that not so. Recovery is not grand, it’s one step in front of the other. Unless your cure is more of the disease.

When success begins to slip from your fingers, understand that you must **work yourself back** to the aspirational phase. You must get back to first principles and best practices.

If your reputation can’t absorb a few blows, it wasn’t worth anything in the first place.

Great people hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don’t much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards. And these standards are much higher than everyone else’s.

The absolute best you’re capable of—that’s the metric to measure yourself against. Your **standards** are. Winning is not enough. Anyone can win. But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves.

Aspiration leads to success (and adversity). Success creates its own adversity (and, hopefully, new ambitions). And adversity leads to aspiration and more success. It’s an endless **loop**.
