NOTE: in harmony with learning from the [[Apprentissage/Lecture-all/Bible - Book/48 law of power]] and [[Atomic Habit - Note de lecture]]:  power, success, wisdom, liberty ... It all come with accumulation of time. 
They are due to discipline leading to exponential result.
BUT nothing is unbreakable, every weakness come from the root, the foundation; HENCE that exponential formula must ALWAYS keep running. Discipline never stop.

#### chap 1, introduction
> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself> \ -  - and you are the easiest person to fool.
> \ - RICHARD FEYNMAN

###### Clinical definition - but not usefull in this book:
Freud was fond of explaining the ego by way of analogy—our ego was the rider on a horse, with our unconscious drives representing the animal while the ego tried to direct them. 
Modern psychologists, on the other hand, use the word “egotist” to refer to someone dangerously focused on themselves and with disregard for anyone else. All these definitions are true enough but of little value outside a clinical setting.

###### Book definition - the one we will use
The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: 
- an unhealthy belief in our own importance. 
- Arrogance. 
- Self-centered ambition.

It’s that petulant child inside every person, the one that chooses getting his or her way over anything or anyone else. The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility—that’s ego. 

It’s the sense of superiority and certainty that exceeds the bounds of confidence and talent.

It’s when the notion of ourselves and the world grows so inflated that it begins to distort the reality that surrounds us.

Bill Walsh: “self-confidence becomes arrogance, assertiveness becomes obstinacy, and self-assurance becomes reckless abandon."


###### Ego destroy us. 
ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have: 
- Of mastering a craft. 
- Of real creative insight. 
- Of working well with others. 
- Of building loyalty and support. 
- Of longevity. 
- Of repeating and retaining your success. 

It repulses advantages and opportunities.
It’s a magnet for enemies and errors. 
It is Scylla and Charybdis.

If ego is the voice that tells us we’re better than we really are, 
THEN we can say ego **==inhibits== true success** BY preventing a direct and honest connection to the world around us. 
-> “If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity.”  by Marina Abramović

One of the early members of Alcoholics Anonymous defined ego as “a conscious separation from.” From what? Everything.

Ego is a ST fixe with LT consequences.

###### Ego was always there, now it's emboldened
Besides the changes in technology, we’re told to believe in our uniqueness above all else. We’re told to think big, live big, to be memorable and “dare greatly.” We think that success requires a bold vision or some sweeping plan.
We see risk-taking swagger and successful people in the media, and eager for our own successes, try to reverse engineer the right attitude, the right pose.

Sure, ego has worked for some. Many of history’s most famous men and women were notoriously egotistical. 
But so were many of its greatest failures. Far more of them, in fact. But here we are with a culture that urges us to roll the dice. To make the gamble, ignoring the stakes.

###### Wherever you are, ego is too.
Ego is the enemy every step along this way. In a sense, ego is the enemy of building, of maintaining, and of recovering. When things come fast and easy, this might be fine. But in times of change, of difficulty . . .

Hense the summaty is:
- Aspire
- Success
- Failure

For the goal of:
- Humble in our aspirations and discpline
- Gracious in our success
- Resilient in our failures, cultivate strength and fortitude during storm. 


When we remove ego, we’re left with what is real. 
What replaces ego is humility, yes—but rock-hard humility and confidence. 
- Whereas ego is artificial, this type of confidence can hold weight. 
- Ego is stolen. Confidence is earned.
- Ego is self-anointed, its swagger is artifice. One is girding yourself, the other gaslighting. 
- It’s the difference between potent and poisonous.


Ego is a false confidence. 


## part 1 - Aspire 

>[!info] Reality and Humility are the cure to ego. 

#### Aspire
> He is a bold surgeon, they say, whose hand does not tremble when he performs an operation upon his own person; 
> and he is often equally bold who does not hesitate to pull off the mysterious veil of self-delusion, which covers from his view the deformities of his own conduct.
> \- ADAM SMITH

Isocrates letter to a young ambitious man Demonicus, the son of Isocrates receltly deceased friend.
The advice ranged from practical to moral are both: “precepts for the years to come” and "noble maxims".
- Regarding ambition “no adornment so becomes you as modesty, justice, and self-control; for these are the virtues by which, as all men are agreed, the character of the young is held in restraint.” 
- “Practice self-control,” he said, warning Demonicus
	- not to fall under the sway of “temper, pleasure, and pain.” 
	- And “abhor flatterers as you would deceivers; for both, if trusted, injure those who trust them.”
- in caracter “Be affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure”
	- and “Be slow in deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves” 
- “best thing which we have in ourselves is good judgment.” 
- Constantly train your intellect, “for the greatest thing in the smallest compass is a sound mind in a human body.”



[[William Tecumseh Sherman]], *one of the greatest American general* favorite quote: 
This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
\ -  Shakespeare


Get belief in yourself au fur est à mesure que tu grandis et réussi tes objectifs. 
Belief in oneself came from achievement. -> Mais tjr rester modeste. 

Where Isocrates and Shakespeare wished us to be self-contained, self-motivated, and ruled by principle, most of us have been trained to do the opposite. 
Our cultural values almost try to make us dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions. For a generation, parentsm guru and teachers have focused on building up everyone’s self-esteem.

One might say that the ability to evaluate one’s own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible. And certainly ego makes it difficult every step of the way. It is certainly more pleasurable to focus on our talents and strengths, but where does that get us? Arrogance and self-absorption inhibit growth. So does fantasy and “vision.”
You must practice seeing yourself with a little distance, cultivating the ability to get out of your own head. Detachment is a sort of natural ego antidote. It’s easy to be emotionally invested and infatuated with your own work. Any and every narcissist can do that. What is rare is not raw talent, skill, or even confidence, but humility, diligence, and self-awareness.

Be able to evaluate your own ability. Be self aware. 

Your work to have truth in it, it must come from truth. If you want to be more than a flash in the pan, you must be prepared to focus on the long term.
HENSE
Think big, act and live small and putting in the time =>  Long term Iteration !!! (-> *link with [[Apprentissage/Lecture-all/Bible - Book/48 law of power]]*)
WHILE, the other, 
With their aggression, intensity, self-absorption, and endless self-promotion, our competitors don’t realize how they jeopardize their own efforts (to say nothing of their sanity)

**Although** we share with many others a vision for greatness, we understand that our path toward it is very different from theirs


#### talk talk talk 
> Those who know do not speak.
> Those who speak do not know.
> \ - LAO TZU

Talk depletes us
- Talking and doing fight for the same resources.
- Talk take action, it go into that uncomfortable zone of uncertainty. 
- Verbalizing to much confuse our mind, tricking it into thinking the job is done. 

CCL: So talk less about your plan and take action. 

The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other.

###### Annecdote:
there is a book called *"Working On My Novel"*, filled with social media posts from writers who are clearly not working on their novels.

###### Economy: 
What is scarce and rare ? Silence
WHILE, Talk is weak and cheap. 

###### Tips: 
conquer what Steven Pressfield calls the “Resistance”—the hurdle that stands between us and creative expression. Success requires a full 100 percent of our effort, and talk flitters part of that effort away before we can use it.

“Void,” Marlon Brando, a quiet actor if there ever was one, once said, “is terrifying to most people.” It is almost as if we are assaulted by silence or confronted by it, particularly if we’ve allowed our ego to lie to us over the years. Which is so damaging for one reason: the greatest work and art comes from wrestling with the void, facing it instead of scrambling to make it go away

###### Ability to gain
The ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsist without its validation. Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong.

-> [[Loi 38 - Think as you like but Behave like others|law of power Silence]]

Hesiod, a poete, "A man’s best treasure is a thrifty tongue".

#### to be or to do? 
> In this formative period, the soul is unsoiled by warfare with the world. It lies, like a block of pure, uncut Parian marble, ready to be fashioned into\ - what?
> \- ORISON SWETT MARDEN

take example from [[John Boyd]].
His one quote is: "==To be of To do?=="
Is an answear to What is your purpose? What are you here to do?
*however, regarding law of power, he didn't master them as he made too much enemy. However, he master his ego !!!*

Do you want to be somebody or to do something?
Having authority different than being authority. 
Having the right is distinct than being right. 

> Nation is born stoic and die epicurean. 


It is not “Who do I want to be in life?” but “What is it that I want to accomplish in life?
Its about the doing, not the recognition. 
Ask yourself : 
- Does it help me do what I have set out to do? 
- Does it allow me to do what I need to do? 
- Am I being selfish or selfless? 
- What is it that I want to accomplish in life? 



#### become a student
> Let No Man’s Ghost Come Back to Say My Training Let Me Down.
> \ - SIGN IN THE NEW YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT TRAINING ACADEMY


Dude that joined Metallica as guitar take guitar courses after joining. 

Studious self assessment everyday cause we always have so much to learn. 

Plus, minus and equal technique, by Frank Shamrock to train fighter:
- Plus : have a person to learn for
	- someone better than you, to LEARN from
- Minus : have a person to teach to 
	- Feiman technic 
- Equal : have an equal to be challenge by

"it is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already know"

###### Take feedback (bonus it kill the ego)
The art of taking feedback is such a crucial skill in life, particularly harsh and critical feedback.
Need actively solicit it, labor to seek out the negative precisely when our friends and family and brain are telling us that we’re doing great. 
-> The ego avoids such feedback at all costs, 
However. Who wants to remand themselves to remedial training? Ego thinks it already knows how and who we are—that is, it thinks we are spectacular, perfect, genius, truly innovative. It dislikes reality and prefers its own assessment.

Ego doesn’t allow for proper incubation either. To become what we ultimately hope to become often takes long periods of obscurity, of sitting and wrestling with some topic or paradox. **Humility** is what keeps us there, concerned that we don’t know enough and that we must continue to study. Ego rushes to the end, rationalizes that patience is for losers (wrongly seeing it as a weakness), and assumes that we’re good enough to give our talents a go in the world.



##### Old proverb
When student is ready, the teacher appears. 

#### dont be passionate 
> You seem to want that *"vivida vis animi"* which spurs and excites most young men to please, to shine, to excel. Without the desire and the pains necessary to be considerable, depend upon it, you never can be so.
> \- LORD CHESTERFIEL


###### Issues with passion
Passion—it’s all about passion. Find your passion. Live passionately. Inspire the world with your passion.
People go to Burning Man, TED and retreat to find passion, to be around passion, to rekindle their passion as they claim "passion" to be life’s most important force.

Here’s what those same people haven’t told you: 
- your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence or accomplishment.
- Because just as often, **we fail because of passion.**


> Learn from Eleanor  Roosevelt was above passion. She had purpose. She had direction. She wasn’t driven by passion, but by ==**reason**==.


###### Reason
> Reason > to passion. 

One great coach of basket -  John Wooden -  was described as "dispassionate". His philosophy was about being in control. 
Wooden wasn’t about rah-rah speeches or inspiration. He saw those extra emotions as a burden. Instead, his philosophy was about being in control and doing your job and never being “passion’s slave.” 


###### What to DO
Need Purpose and Realism. 
Purpose =  passion with boundaries. 
Realism is detachment and perspective.

**understand**
Passion is "about": 
- I am so passionate about  ...... . 
Purpose is "to" and "for":
- I must do ...... . 
- I was put here to accomplish ...... .
- I am willing to endure ...... . for the sake of this.

Actually, **purpose** deemphasizes the "I". Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.


Goethe : "Great passions are maladies without hope". 
Which is why a deliberate, purposeful person operates on a different level, beyond the sway or the sickness. They hire professionals and use them. They ask questions, they ask what could go wrong, they ask for examples. They plan for contingencies. Then they are off to the races. Usually they get started with small steps, complete them, and look for feedback on how the next set can be better. They lock in gains, and then get better as they go, often leveraging those gains to grow exponentially rather than arithmetically.

Leave passion for the amateurs. Make it about what you feel you must do and say, not what you care about and wish to be. Remember Talleyrand’s epigram for diplomats : *surtout pas trop de zèle*.
-> then you will do great think WHEN you stop being that good intentioned person and ineffective self. 

#### follow the canvas strategy 
> Great men have almost always shown themselves as ready to obey as they afterwards proved able to command.
> \ - LORD MAHON


The angry, unappreciated genius is forced to do stuff she doesn’t like, for people he doesn’t respect, as he makes hus way in the world. How dare they force me to grovel like this! The injustice! The waste!
And the same disregard appear when following this advice: "Make other people look good and you will do well. Keep your head down, they say, and serve your boss"

Let’s flip it around so it doesn’t seem so demeaning: It’s not about kissing ass. It’s not about making someone look good. It’s about providing the support so that others can be good. The better wording for the advice is this: Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself.
-> [[Loi 1 - Ne jamais surpasser le maître]]

> Greatness come from humble beginning, it comes from grunt work. It mean you're the last important person in the room. 

When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities:
1) You’re not nearly as good or as important as you think you are; 
2) You have an attitude that needs to be readjusted; 
3) Most of what you think you know OR most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong.

There’s one fabulous way to work all that out of your system: 
- attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful 
- and subsume your identity into theirs 
- and move both forward simultaneously.
\ -> It’s certainly more glamorous to pursue your own glory—though hardly as effective. Obeisance is the way forward.

Other effect of this attitude: **it reduces your ego at a critical time in your career**, letting you absorb everything you can *(learning, being a Student of life*) without the obstructions that block others’ vision and progress.

No one is endorsing sycophancy. Instead, it’s about seeing what goes on from the inside, and looking for opportunities for someone other than yourself. 


Example of Benjamin Franklin who wrote under speudonym to learn about public opinion. He even use this tactic to undermind enemy !!

> A critical lesson in politics: that if you want to give a coach/master a feedback or question a decision, you needed to do it in private and self-effacingly so as not to offend your superior

###### Be lesser, do more 
Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room—until you change that with results
Just like "Say little, do much.""

###### TIPS
Imagine if every person you meet, you think of a way to help them. That benefit them and not you. Think about what you can do for them. 
 - The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound: 
	 - You’d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. 
	 - You’d develop a reputation for being indispensable. 
	 - You’d have countless new relationships.
	 - You’d have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road.

>[!info] That’s what the canvas strategy is about—helping yourself by helping other

It is the idea of the canvas strategy : short term gratification for long term strategy. 

Let other take credit of your actionand be glad they took it. Because you defer and earn interest on the principal. 

-> you’ll see what most people’s egos prevent them from appreciating: the person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting.


#### restrain yourself 
> I have observed that those who have accomplished the greatest results are those who “keep under the body”; are those who never grow excited or lose self-control, but are always calm, self-possessed, patient, and polite.
> \ - BOOKER T. WASHINGTON

[[Jackie Robinson]], 1st black Baseball player. Young he was know for fighting injustice. When he become a baseball player, he MASTER the art of: "Having the guts not to fight back".

###### Self control
Have self control, stay calm, self possess, patient and polite. 
->  Of course, you’ll want to throw that in other people’s faces. Worse, you’ll want to get in other people’s faces, people who don’t deserve the respect, recognition, or rewards they are getting. 
In fact, those people will often get perks instead of you. When someone doesn’t reckon you with the seriousness that you’d like, the impulse is to correct them. (As we all wish to say: Do you know who I am?!) You want to remind them of what they’ve forgotten; your ego screams for you to indulge it.
Instead, **you must do nothing**. Take it. Eat it until you’re sick. Endure it. Quietly brush it off and work harder. Play the game. Ignore the noise; for the love of God, do not let it distract you. Restraint is a difficult skill but a critical one

###### CCL
Your own path will be in some way define by the amount of non-sense we are willing do deal with. 

It doesn't degrade you when other treat you poorly, it degrade them. 

Can change the system after you have made it. 
In the meantime, you’ll have to find some way to make it suit your purposes—even if those purposes are just extra time to develop properly, to learn from others on their dime, to build your base and establish yourself.


#### get out of your own head 
> A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions.
> \- ALAN WATTS


Platon talk about the mistake of "feasting on their own thoughts". As sadly, to many real people preferring to live in passionate fiction than in actual reality.

Danger of letting the voice of the EGO blast wild into our head, singing and praising us all the time. 

Our imagination is an asset but dangerous when it runs wild.
Concept of “imaginary audience.” by David Elkind regarding adolescence. Consider a thirteen-year-old so embarrassed that he misses a week of class, positive that the entire school is thinking and murmuring about some tiny incident that in truth hardly anyone noticed. Or a teenage girl who spends three hours in front of the mirror each morning, as if she’s about to go on stage. They do this because they’re convinced that their every move is being watched with rapt attention by the rest of the world.
->Even as adults, we’re susceptible to this fantasy during a harmless walk down the street. We plug in some headphones and all of a sudden there’s a soundtrack. We flip up our jacket collar and consider briefly how cool we must look. We replay the successful meeting we’re heading toward in our head. The crowds part as we pass. We’re fearless warriors, on our way to the top.

It’s the opening credits montage. It’s a scene in a novel. It feels good—so much better than those feelings of doubt and fear and normalness—and so we stay stuck inside our heads instead of participating in the world around us.
That’s ego, baby.



> [!info] There is no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us. 


#### the danger of early pride 
>  proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.
> \ - C. S. LEWIS


Christians believe that pride is a sin because it is a lie—it convinces people that they are better than they are, that they are better than God made them. Pride leads to arrogance and then away from humility and connection with their fellow man.

What a pitiful thing it is when a man lets a little temporary succes spoil him, warp is jugement and he forget what he is. 

-> “Whom the gods wish to destroy,” Cyril Connolly famously said, “they first call promising.” 

Let’s call that attitude  - pride - what it is: **fraud**. If you’re doing the work and putting in the time, you won’t need to cheat, you won’t need to overcompensate.


> “vain men never hear anything but praise.”
> \ - Le petit Prince

So receive Feedback to kill our pride !!


Genghis Khan : "if you can't swallow your pride, you can't lead. "

> Protect yourself against the validation and gratification. 


At the end, this isn’t about deferring pride because you don’t deserve it yet. 
- It isn’t
	- “Don’t boast about what hasn’t happened yet.” 
- **It is** more directly
	- ==“Don’t boast.” There’s nothing in it for you.==


###### Question to ask when feel pride:
- What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see
- What I am avoiding or running from with my bluster, frantic eds and embellishments? 

It is far better to ask and answer these question now, with the stakes still low, than it will be later.

###### Rule to fight Pride
- Privately thinking you are better than other is still pride and it's dangerous. 
- "That on wich you so pride yourself will be your ruin. You who think yourself to be someone"
- Dont boast. There is nothing in it for you. 
- We must prepare for pride and kill it early—or it will kill what we aspire to. 
	- . “The first product of self-knowledge is humility,” Flannery O’Connor once said. This is how we fight the ego, by really knowing ourselves.



#### work work work 
> The best plan is only good intentions unless it degenerates into work.
> \ - PETER DRUCKER

“You can’t build a reputation on what you’re going to do,” 
\ - Henry Ford
-> Having an idea is not enough, you need to work. 


We simply need the humbleness to be patient.

Ego want the hour we spend planing to be paid well. 
Our ego wants the ideas and the fact that: we aspire to do something about them to be enough.
Ego wants the hours we spend planning and attending conferences or chatting with impressed friends to count toward the tally that success seems to require.
Ego  wants to be paid well for its time and it wants to do the fun stuff—the stuff that gets attention, credit, or glory.
BUT in reality, where we decide to put our energy decides what we’ll ultimately accomplish.
-> WORK WORK WOR

###### So:
Do we sit down, alone, and struggle with our work?
Work that may or may not go anywhere, that may be discouraging or painful?
Do we love work, making a living to do work, not the other way around? 
Do we love practice, the way great athletes do?

Or do we chase short-term attention and validation—whether that’s indulging in the endless search for ideas or simply the distraction of talk and chatter?

-> **Fac, si facis**. (Do it if you’re going to do it.)

Work is finding yourself alone at the track when the weather kept everyone else indoors. Work is pushing through the pain and crappy first drafts and prototypes. It is ignoring whatever plaudits others are getting, and more importantly, ignoring whatever plaudits you may be getting. Because there is work to be done. Work doesn’t want to be good. It is made so, despite the headwind.

> You know a workman by the chips they leave. It’s true. 
> To judge your progress properly, just take a look at the floor.


###### Materiam superabat opus. 
(The workmanship was better than the material.)
The material we’ve been given genetically, emotionally, financially, that’s where we begin. We don’t control that. We do control what we make of that material, and whether we squander it.



#### For everything that commes next, ego is the enemy... 
> ’Tis a common proof,
> That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder.
> \ - SHAKESPEARE

Ego give us excuses. 
Be ambitious in your aims and accept that in the path you will make plenty of mistakes. 


ure was worth it.”

###### Taste/Talent Gap.
The internal debate about confidence calls to mind a well-known concept from the radio pioneer Ira Glass, which could be called the Taste/Talent Gap:
All of us who do creative work . . . we get into it because we have good taste. But it’s like there’s a gap, that for the first couple years that you’re making stuff, what you’re making isn’t so good . . . It’s really not that great. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not quite that good. 
But your taste—the thing that got you into the game—your taste is still killer, and your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you’re making is kind of a disappointment to you.


## part 2 
###### intro
Here we are at the top of a mountain we worked hard to climb—or at least the summit is in sight. Now we face new temptations and problems. We breathe thinner air in an unforgiving environment. Why is success so ephemeral?
Ego shortens it. 
- We stop learning,
- we stop listening,
- and we lose our grasp on what matters. 
- We become victims of ourselves and the competition.

Great stabilizers, to balance out ego and pride that comes with achievement and recognition:
- **Sobriety**, 
- **Open**-**mindedness**,
- **Organization**, 
- and **Purpose**

#### success 
> Two different characters are presented to our emulation; the one, of proud ambition and ostentatious avidity. The other, of humble modesty and equitable justice. Two different models, two different pictures, are held out to us, according to which we may fashion our own character and behaviour; the one more gaudy and glittering in its colouring; the other more correct and more exquisitely beautiful in its outline.
> \ - ADAM SMITH


Why is succes so ephemeral? Ego shortens it. 
Because we stop learning, listening, we lose our grasp of what matter. 
Also practice gratitude. 

Why empire seem to always colapse from within? 


Without virtue and training, Aristotle observed, “it is hard to bear the results of good fortune suitably.” 

Ego wants us to think, I’m special. I’m better. The rules don’t apply to me.

Can you handle success? Or will it be the worst thing that ever happened to you?


#### always stay a student
> Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him.
> \ - RALPH WALDO EMERSON


Gengis khans learn the best of each culture. His growing is describe as: “a persistent cycle of pragmatic learning, experimental adaptation, and constant revision driven by his uniquely disciplined and focused will."
he Mongol Empire was remarkable for its religious freedoms, and most of all, for its love of ideas and convergence of cultures. The Khan always had transators with him during his conquest for the only goal of learning from every great mind of the city. 

The more you known, the more your ignorance grow.
-> also remember any learning get degrad over time, as new research come and it become more and more democratise. 

Someone trully humble observe and listen.

###### Wynton Marsalis quote
"Humility engenders learning because it beats back the arrogance that puts blinders on. 
It (humility) leaves you open for truths to reveal themselves. 

You don’t stand in your own way. . . .

Do you know how you can tell when someone is truly humble?
I believe there’s one simple test: because they consistently observe and listen, the humble improve. They don’t assume, ‘I know the way.’”

###### CCL
Put yourself in rooms where you’re the least knowledgeable person. That uncomfortable feeling, that defensiveness that you feel when your most deeply held assumptions are challenged - what about subjecting yourself to it deliberately?
Change your mind.
Change your surroundings.


Most military cultures—and people in general—seek to impose values and control over what they encounter. What made the Mongols different was their ability to weigh each situation objectively, and if need be, swap out previous practices for new ones. 



Understand HOW you learn and set up process to accelerate it. 

#### dont tell yourself a story

> Myth become myth not in the living but in the retelling. - \ - David Maraniss

Bill Walsh, best NFL coach implemented a "standard of performance". 
->That is what should be done: When & How. 
It's about installing excellence. 
Don't think about timeline, just instal excellence. 
Cause if the player take care of the detail, then the score take care of itself. 

Cause you didn't know it would happen, you think, you believe it could happen. 

Focus on the task at hand, not in the story. 

It's important to keep the high standard so the story quit your mind. Also it's when you win that you need it the most (*the standard of excellence*), to learn, improve, listen and get feedback. 

There is no "haha moment" or sudden moment of clarity / envision, it's habit that build the success.

Don't go into building narrative and cute story. The reality is always some draft, neddle thought and somehow it work (just like in code). So keep doing with excellence, cause that 1% change have a compound effect.


###### "The way to do big think seems to start with deceptively small think."
Investor Paul Graham (*who invested in Airbnb, reddit, Dropbox, and others*),  explicitly warns startups against having bold, sweeping visions early on. Of course, as a capitalist, he wants to fund companies that massively disrupt industries and change the world- that’s where the money is. He wants them to have “frighteningly ambitious” ideas.
But he explains, “The way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things.” He’s saying you don’t make a frontal attack out of ego; instead, you start with a small bet and iteratively scale your ambitions as you go. His other famous piece of advice, “Keep your identity small,” fits well here. Make it about the work and the principles behind it—not about a glorious vision that makes a good headline.


###### Tips
A great destiny, Seneca reminds us, is great slavery.

There is a real danger in believing it when people use the word “genius”- and it’s even more dangerous when we let hubris tell ourselves we are one. 
The same goes for any label that comes along with a career; are we suddenly a “filmmaker,” “writer,” “investor,” “entrepreneur,” or “executive” because we’ve accomplished one thing? 
These labels put you at odds 
- with reality, 
- and with the real strategy that made you successful in the first place.
	- It was work, creativity, persistence, and luck that put you on succes.

Start with iterative scale and small bet. 



#### what is important for you 
> To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age.
> \ - ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON


Story of Grant and Sherman. Grant ended up failing (in politic and business) all he try to do (after being an amazing general) cause he didn't know what he wants.
That’s how it seems to go: 
- we’re never happy with what we have, 
- we want what others have too.
- We want to have more than everyone else. 

-> We start out knowing what is important to us, but once we’ve achieved it, we lose sight of our priorities. 
Ego sways us, and can ruin us

SO: use your time to do something you like. 
AND: at an individual level, it’s absolutely critical that you know who you’re competing with and why, that you have a clear sense of the space you’re in.

###### *euthymia*
Idea of the Greek word *euthymia* (popularise by Seneca). 

It is the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it. 
<=>  it’s not about 
- beating the other guy. 
- having more than the others. 

It’s about 
- being what you are, and being as good as possible at it, without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it.
- going where you set out to go. 
- accomplishing the most that you’re capable of in what you choose. 

That’s it. No more and no less. 
Euthymia means “tranquillity” in English.


###### CCL
Ego rejects trade-offs: Why compromise? Ego wants it all.
Ego tells you to cheat, though you love your spouse. Because you want what you have and what you don’t have. Ego says that sure, even though you’re just starting to get the hang of one thing, why not jump right in the middle of another? Eventually, you say yes to too much, to something too far beyond the pale. We’re like Captain Ahab, chasing Moby Dick, for reasons we don’t even understand anymore.

WHILE Life require trade off that ego refuse, *like being opera and pop icone.* 

> why do you do what you do ?

Find why you are after what you are after.

#### entitlement, control and paranoia
> One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important.
> \ - Bertrand Russell

“The Strongest Poison ever known,” the poet William Blake wrote, “came from Caesar’s Laurel Crown.” Success casts a spell over us.
-> think about Xerxes, who lashes a river

Achieving succès mean gaining against all odd, taking a lot of risk, athletic victory... BUT it doesn't mean you can let the ego win. "Compassion is always due", you got to skip to the discipline and humble attitude that take you here. 

Control say it must be done my ways even little think, it become perfectionism. It can become paralyzing perfectionism, or a million pointless battles fought merely for the sake of exerting its say. And this exhaust you, you waste energy -> hence lost your discipline and possible investment of your energy.

Paranoia thinks, I can’t trust anyone. I’m in this totally by myself and for myself. It says, I’m surrounded by fools. It says, focusing on my work, my obligations, myself is not enough. I also have to be orchestrating various machinations behind the scenes—to get them before they get me; to get them back for the slights I perceive.
And you lose energy trying to manipulate and get rid of imaginary coup d'état against you. 


 >"He who indulges empty fears earns himself real fears,” 
 >\ - Seneca

The sad feedback loop is that the relentless “looking out for number one” can encourage other people to undermine and fight us. They see that behavior for what it really is: a mask for weakness, insecurity, and instability. In its frenzy to protect itself, paranoia creates the persecution it seeks to avoid, making the owner a prisoner of its own delusions and chaos.
-> go back to your WHY !!

#### Managing yourself
> It is not enough to have great qualities; we should also have the management of them. 
> \ - La Rochefoucauld. 

Learn to manage yourself before learning to manage other. 

Management? That’s the reward for all your creativity and new ideas? Becoming the Man? 
**Yes**—in the end, we all face becoming the adult supervision we originally rebelled against. 
Yet often we react petulantly and prefer to think: "Now that I’m in charge, things are going to be different!"


President job, is to set the priorities, to think big picture, and then trust the people beneath him to do the jobs they were hired for (Eisenhower).

As you become successful in your own field, your responsibilities may begin to change. Days become less and less about doing and more and more about making decisions. Such is the nature of leadership. This transition requires reevaluating and updating your identity. It requires a certain humility to put aside some of the more enjoyable or satisfying parts of your previous job. It means accepting that others might be more qualified or specialized in areas in which you considered yourself competent—or at least their time is better spent on them than yours.


#### Beware the disease of me
> If I am not for myself who will be for me? If I am only for myself, who I am?

###### Great team trajectory
Great teams tend to follow a trajectory. 

When they start—before they have won—a team is innocent. If the conditions are right,
- they come together, 
- they watch out for each other 
- and work together toward their collective goal.

This stage, is calls the “Innocent Climb.”

After a team starts to win and media attention begins, the simple bonds that joined the individuals together begin to fray.
- Players calculate their own importance.
- Chests swell. 
- Frustrations emerge. 
- Egos appear.

The Innocent Climb,  says, is almost always followed by the “Disease of Me.”
-> It can “strike any winning team in any year and at any moment,” and does with alarming regularity.
Then player can't play with each other, it's player pushing there team member.

EGO manifest as: 
For us, it’s beginning to think that we’re better, that we’re special, that our problems and experiences are so incredibly different from everyone else’s that no one could possibly understand. It’s an attitude that has sunk far better people, teams, and causes than ours.


###### Ego, confidance and Honor
Ego need honor in orther to be validate, confidence is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition.
General Marshall, refuse chief of staff and Field Marshal cause he though himself not ready and to not go beyond his dying mentor - a general. 

Let’s make one thing clear: we never earn the right to be greedy or to pursue our interests at the expense of everyone else. To think otherwise is not only egotistical, it’s counterproductive.
*Marshal did not take the offer of being in charge of the DDay, letting the best man for the job Eisenhower doing it.*


###### Tips
Be **magnanimous**, even with the one that hurt you during your climb. 

Who has time to look at picture of yourself? 
Time spent with marketing and media is time lost to your task. 

Think about the life of Marshal. 
-> humility and selflessness. 

There is a balance. Soccer coach Tony Adams expresses it well. Play for the name on the front of the jersey, he says, and they’ll remember the name on the back.
-> Who care about the credit? Just do what must be done.
#### Meditate on the immensity
> a monk is a man who is separated from all and who is in harmony with all
> - Evagrius Poncticus

###### Sympatheia
**Sympatheia** - state of connectedness with the cosmos (stoism). Sense of belonging to something larger.

The French philosopher Pierre Hadot has referred to it as the “oceanic feeling.” A sense of belonging to something larger, of realizing that “human things are an infinitesimal point in the immensity.” 

**Sympatheia** state help us answer questions such as : 
- who I am?
- what I'm doing?
- what is my role? 


###### how ego attack Sympatheia
Ego tell us that being at the center of attention is the way. 
Then we  lack that connection to anything larger or bigger than us, it’s like a piece of our soul is gone. Ego blocks us from the beauty and history in the world. It stands in the way.
And we find success empty, we’re exhausted. 

So find something bigger than you, find your [lighthouse].

Go into the wild, the nature or to a place of ancien history to think and get inspired. Also, nature is good to relax. 
-> feel the immensity and become more humble. 

###### Tips
seek out the cosmic sympathy: famous Blake poem that opens with
- “To see a World in a Grain of Sand / 
- And a Heaven in a Wild Flower /
- Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / 
- And Eternity in an hour.” 
- -> That’s what we’re after here. That’s the transcendental experience that makes our petty ego impossible.

> it's hard to be humble when you are as great as I am
> - Muhammad Ali


Remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to one-up those around you. 

Realise how much come before you. And let this feeling carry you.

#### Maintain your sobriety
> the height of cultivation runs to simplicity  
> - Bruce Lee


- [ ] read again and note on the philosopher. 
###### Merkel
Sober like Angela Merkel, be modest, plain, care little for flash presentation. Give no fierce speech, have no interest in expension or domination. 
Stay quiet and reserve.
Know what's important and focus on the result. 

> You can't solve task with charisma
> - Angela Merkel 


###### tips 
QUOI - goal :  Sobriety of ego. 
WHY:  we think that people become successful through sheer energy and enthusiasm. 
We excuse ego because we think it’s part and parcel of the personality required to “make it big.” But let’s ask:
- Is it really sustainable for the next several decades?
- Can you really outwork and outrun everyone forever?

The answer is no. The ego tells us we’re invincible, that we have unlimited force that will never dissipate. BUT we ain't !!!

Historian Shelby Foote observed 
- “power doesn’t so much corrupt; that’s too simple. It fragments, closes options, mesmerizes.”
	- That’s what ego does.
	- It clouds the mind precisely when it needs to be clear.
- HENCE: **Sobriety** is a counterbalance, a hangover cure—or better, a prevention method.

Other politicians are bold and charismatic. But as Merkel supposedly said, “You ca


QUI: exemple de Merkel

Ou et Quand: a tout moment de notre vie. 

COMMENT: 
- Zen teaching
- hangover cure.
- command of oneself.
- escape what Marc Aurelus called “imperialization”
	- HOW: "fight to be the person philosophy tried to make you.”
- James Basford: “It requires a strong constitution to withstand repeated attacks of prosperity.”
-  No more obsessing about your image -> stay sober:
	- whom feedback you listen, who you promote, how you interact ...
	- <=> how spend energy !!


Zen philosopher Zuigan is supposed to have called out to himself everyday:
“MASTER—”
“YES, SIR?”
Then he would add:
“BECOME SOBER.”
“YES, SIR.”
He would conclude by saying:
“DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY OTHERS.”
“YES SIR, YES SIR.”
Today, we might add to that:
“DON’T BE DECEIVED BY RECOGNITION YOU HAVE GOTTEN OR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.”


#### for what come next, ego is the enemy...
> the evidence is in, and you are the verdict. 
> \ - Anne Lamott

###### Napoléon  
> man of great ambition have sought happiness... But have found fame. 
> \ - Napoléon

It mean being every goal is the drive to be happy and fulfilled. 
However, when egoism take hold, we lost track of our goal and end up somewhere else we never intended to. 
Cause in the end, after Napoléon death, Europe get back as it was before.

Howard Hughes had a reputation of a bold maverick. However on his death bed, he admit not liking his life. 


###### Golden rule of Artisote
Example of Alexander, ill by his own man; he just never grasped Aristotle’s “golden mean”—that is, the middle ground.

Repeatedly, Aristotle speaks of virtue and excellence as points along a spectrum.
- Courage, lies between cowardice and recklessness 
- Generosity, lies between profligacy and parsimony.

Where the line is, it is difficult to tell, but without finding it, we risk dangerous extremes. 
This is why it is so hard to be excellent.

>  Aristotle:. “In each case, it is hard work to find the intermediate; for instance, not everyone, but only one who knows, finds the **midpoint in a circle.**

Take aways: We can use the golden mean to navigate our ego and our desire to achieve.

###### CCL
Instead of letting power make us delusional and instead of taking what we have for granted,
we’d be better to spend our time preparing for the shifts of fate that inevitably occur in life: 
- That is, adversity, difficulty, failure.
- CAUSE: Reversals and regressions are as much a part of the cycle of life as anything else.


## part 3 
###### intro
Here we are experiencing the trials endemic to any journey: 
-  failure, 
- goal turned out to be harder to achieve than anticipated. 

No one is permanently successful, and not everyone finds success on the first attempt. 

When dealing with setbacks, ego not only leaves us unprepared BUT it contributed to their occurrence in the first place. 

The way through, the way to rise again, requires
- a reorientation 
- and increased self-awareness.
- purpose, poise, and patience.
	- *we don’t need pity - our own or anyone else’s -* 


#### Failure 
> It is because mankind are disposed to sympathize more entirely with our joy than with our sorrow, that we make parade of our riches, and conceal our poverty. Nothing is so mortifying as to be obliged to expose our distress to the view of the public, and to feel, that though our situation is open to the eyes of all mankind, no mortal conceives for us the half of what we suffer.
> \ - ADAM SMITH


as Gilgamesh  though about Fate:
> he will face a battle he knows not 
> he will ride a road he knows not

###### Golden Ball metaphore
As George Goodman once observed,
- it is as if “we are at a wonderful ball where the champagne sparkles in every glass and soft laughter falls upon the summer air. We know at some moment the black horsemen will come shattering through the terrace doors wreaking vengeance and scattering the survivors. Those who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking—what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.”

He was speaking of economic crises, although he may as well have been talking about where all of us find ourselves, not just once in our lifetimes, but often. Things are going well. Perhaps we’re aspiring to some big goal. Perhaps we’re finally enjoying the fruits of our labors. At any point, fate can intervene.

If success is ego intoxication, then failure can be a devastating ego blow—turning slips into falls and little troubles into great unravelings. If ego is often just a nasty side effect of great success, it can be fatal during failure.

We have many names for these problems: Sabotage. Unfairness. Adversity. Trials. Tragedy. No matter the label, it’s a trial. We don’t like it, and some of us are sunk by it. Others seem to be built to make it through. In either case, it’s a trial each person must endure.


###### Katharine Graham
One of the most formidable CEO, Graham the CEO of Washington Post. Had a decade and half of "batheme de feu" but in the end, she make the company up to the SPC 500.

She succed cause she had PURPOSE. It wasn’t about her. It was about preserving her family’s legacy. Protecting the paper. Doing her job.


###### Life isn’t fair.
Ego loves this notion, the idea that something is “fair” or not. Psychologists call it narcissistic injury when we take personally totally indifferent and objective events. 
- We do that when our sense of self is fragile and dependent on life going our way all the time. 

BUT: Whether what you’re going through is your fault or your problem doesn’t matter, BECAUSE it’s yours to deal with right now.



###### Tips
> Goethe on the great failing:
> "to see yourself as more than you are and to value yourself at less than your true worth". 



When face difficulty, ego show it true color. 
- Will ego betray you ? 
- Will ego say I know you couldn't do it ? 
- Ego will say **it is someone else problem**, AND
	- ego will try to wash your hand of it.
	- Ego will also add self injury. 


Humble and strong people don’t have the same trouble with these troubles that egotists do. There are fewer complaints and far less self-immolation.
Instead, there’s stoic—even cheerful—resilience. Pity isn’t necessary. Their identity isn’t threatened. They can get by without constant validation.


> what matter is that we can respond to what life throws at us

As Plutarch say: 
“The future bears down upon each one of us with all the hazards of the unknown.” 
-> The only way out is through




#### Alive time or dead time? 
> vivre sans temps mort
> slogan parisien

Malcom X go to prison and read book for 7 years, it's what is call Alive time. Time us to gain/improve    

Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.
- dead time, when people are passive and waiting, 
	- is also about letting the Ego control us
- and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utilizing every second. 


In hard situation it would be easier and make you feel better to just be angry, depressed heartbroken... But this is shortsighted. 
Instead think and said : "this is a' opportunity for me, I can us that for my purpose. I will not let this be dead time for me".


“Cast down your bucket where you are.” (Booker T.Washington) Make use of what’s around you. Don’t let stubbornness make a bad situation worse.


#### The effort is enough
> what matters to an active man is to do the right thing; whether the right thing comes to pass should not bother him 
> - Goethe

Story of [[Belisarius]]. 
Just like him, many people will not be appreciate for they work. They will do invention ahead of their time. 
And ego will tell you, Should they have not done it?? 

When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effort—not the results, good or bad—is enough.
For the ego, this is not nearly sufficient. No, we need to be recognized. We need to be compensated. Especially problematic is the fact that, often, we get that. We are praised, we are paid, and we start to assume that the two things always go together. The “expectation hangover” inevitably ensues.


There is think in your control and not. 
The less attached to the outcome, the better. 
Fulfill your self with your own standards.

Exemple of Alexander and Diogenes encounter. With can't let praise and impressment motivate us. 

*this too, can bear - I still*
*Am Belisarius!*


> Change your definition of succes:
> - Succes is peace of mind. 
> - Success is the result of self satisfaction knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best.


“Ambition,” Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, “means tying your well-being to what other people say or do . . . Sanity means tying it to your own actions."


Do your work, do it well. Then let go and let the Univers decide if it is usefull for mankind.

#### Fight club moments
> If you shut up truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow, and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it burst through it will blow up everything in its way. 
> - Émile Zola


###### katabasis
In Greek mythology, characters often experience katabasis—or “a going down.” They’re forced to retreat, they experience a depression, or in some cases literally descend into the underworld. When they emerge, it’s with heightened knowledge and understanding.
We surround ourselves with bullshit. With distractions. With lies about what makes us happy and what’s important. We become people we shouldn’t become and engage in destructive, awful behaviors. This unhealthy and ego-derived state hardens and becomes almost permanent. Until katabasis forces us to face it.


###### the fall
*Duris dura franguntur.* Hard things are broken by hard things.
The bigger the ego the harder the fall
Going down force us to fasse all the unhealthy and ego derived state of our life. 

The Reverend William A. Sutton observed some 120 years ago that “we cannot be humble except by enduring humiliations.”

###### Fight club moment
Fight club moment are 
- catalys for changes we where petrified to make. 
- those moments - when the break exposes something unseen before - that you were forced to make eye contact with a thing called Truth. 
	- No longer could you hide or pretend.

These kind of momen are defined by three traits :
1. They almost always came at the hands of some outside force or person. 
2. They often involved things we already knew about ourselves, but where too scare to admit. 
3. From the ruin came the opportunity got great progress and improvement. 

###### tips
Careful cause ego may block the opportunity and growth. 

Turning away from true only decay the fall. And the more we wait, the more deadly the fall is. 

The feeling after rock bottom is one of the most powerful perspectives in the world. 

In the end, the only way you can appreciate your progress is to stand on the edge of the hole you dug for yourself, look down inside it, and smile fondly at the bloody claw prints that marked your journey up the walls.


#### Draw the line
> It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character
> \- Marc Aurelius

Some people associate their business and entrepreneurship with their person. As who they are. And let good life and good money fighting for a lost cause. 
We take risk, and we mess up. 
That's life. 
The problem is that when we get our identity tied up in our work, we worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad about us as a person. It’s a fear of taking responsibility, of admitting that we might have messed up. 
It’s the sunk cost fallacy. 


Have the courage to make a full stop. 
OR Ego kills may what we love; and sometimes, it comes close to killing us too.

Shit happen, and shit happen in public too. Are you going to make it worst? 
Or emerge with dignity and character intact? 

Most trouble are temporary. 
Recovery is one step after the other. 


When failure, we have to understand thatweyou must work ourself back to the aspirational phase. We must get back to first principles and best practices.
> “He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man,” 
> \ - Seneca once said. 
> Alter that: He who will do anything to avoid failure will almost certainly do something worthy of a failure.


The only real failure is abandoning your principles. Killing what you love because you can’t bear to part from it is selfish and stupid. 
If your reputation can’t absorb a few blows, it wasn’t worth anything in the first place.


#### Maintain your own scorecard
> I never look back, except to find out about mistakes... 
> I only see danger in thinking back about things you are proud of. 
> Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann

Make a distinction between your inner scoreboard and the external one. 
external: winning is not enought cause we can just get lucky. 
But not everyone is the best possible version of themselves. Hence, the need for an internal scoreboard.


-> Maintaint yourself to your own standard.
Think about the story of Brady (Football player). 

“Vain men never hear anything but praise.” 



It's not about you can get away with, it's about if you should or shouldn't do. Don't enter the excuse of the "grey area" !!

Our view of our action are partiate. Especially when they shouldn't. Like when we are about to act, the eagerness of passion may make true reflection and impartiality hard. 

We have to be the indifferent spectator. A guide to judge our behavior. 

Hold your action against a standard, and bab grey area or no one will know. 

A person that hold himself to his own standards doesn't crave for the spotlight the same way plus he is less selfish and self absorbed.


Reflecting on what went well or how amazing we are doesn’t get us anywhere, except maybe to where we are right now. But we want to go further, we want more, we want to continue to improve. If we’re racked with greed, but instead, we’re inching our way toward real improvement, with discipline rather than disposition.
=> Go with discipline 

###### Adam Smith
Adam Smith had a theory for how wise and good people evaluate their actions:

There are two different occasions upon which we examine our own conduct, and endeavour to view it in the light in which the impartial spectator would view it: 
- first, when we are about to act;
- and secondly, after we have acted. 

Our views are apt to be very partial in both cases; but they are apt to be most partial when it is of most importance that they should be otherwise. When we are about to act, the eagerness of passion will seldom allow us to consider what we are doing, with the candour of an indifferent person. . . . When the action is over, indeed, and the passions which prompted it have subsided, we can enter more coolly into the sentiments of the indifferent spectator.

=> “indifferent spectator” is a sort of guide with which we can judge our behavior, as opposed to the groundless applause that society so often gives out. Not that it’s just about validation, though.

#### Always love
> And why should we feel anger at the world? 
> As if the world will notice!
> - Euripides

Story of Hearst an ultra rich American who want to destroy a movie (from Orson Welles) that he think was a critic of him.
By trying it, he reveal to america how much a bad person he was. It is call the Streisand effect (after an actress doing the same for a photo). 


You know what is a better response to an attack or a slight or something you don’t like? Love
Instead of hate, use love. 
Have love for that bastard. 
Or if you can't, let it go. Shake your head and laugh about it. 


Where have hated and rage get anyone anywhere? 
Are we going to be miserable just because other people are? 
-> concept of drinking poison to poison someone else. 

Love is right there. Egoless, open, positive, vulnerable, peaceful, and productive.

#### For everything that comes next, ego is the enemy 
> I don't like work - no man does - buy I like what is in the work - the chance to find yourself
>  - Joseph Conrad

###### Churchill
In William Manchester’s epic biography of the life of Winston Churchill, the middle volume—a third of the set—is titled Alone.
For a full eight years, Churchill stood more or less by himself against his shortsighted peers, against the rising threat of fascism, even among the West.
But eventually, he triumphed again. And faced adversity again. And was vindicated again.


###### Difficulty
There is no way around it: We will experience difficulty. We will feel the touch of failure. 
As Benjamin Franklin observed, those who “drink to the bottom of the cup must expect to meet with some of the dregs.”

But what if those dregs weren’t so bad? 
As Harold Geneen put it, “People learn from their failures. Seldom do they learn anything from success.” 
-> It’s why the old Celtic saying tells us, “See much, study much, suffer much, that is the path to wisdom.”


###### Conclusion:
Wisdom or ignorance? Ego is the swing vote.
Aspiration leads to success (and adversity). Success creates its own adversity (and, hopefully, new ambitions). And adversity leads to aspiration and more success. It’s an endless loop.

Mantra:
*not to aspire or seek out if ego.*
*to have success without ego.*
*to push through failure with strength, not ego.*

#### Epilogue
> There is something of a civil war going on within all of our lives. There is a recalcitrant South of our soul revolting against the North of our soul. And there is this continual struggle within the very structure of every individual life. 
> - Martin Luther King Jr. 

Training is like sweeping the floor, just because we've done it once, doesn't mean the floor is clean forever. => Same with fighting ego. 

Karma for bad behavior can be the illness of ego (paranoia, failed relationships...)

Bismarck: Any fool can learn from experience, the trick is to learn form other's people experience. 

Plutarch’s reflection that we don’t “so much gain the knowledge of things by the words, as words by the experience [we have] of things.”
