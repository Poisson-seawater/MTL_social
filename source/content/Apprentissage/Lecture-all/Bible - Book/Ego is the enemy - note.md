#### chap 1, introduction
Ego destroy us. 
3 part in this book :
- Aspire
- Success
- Failure
To supress ego and replace it sith with humility, confidence and discipline. 
Ego is a false confidence. 



## part 1 - Aspire 
Reality is the cure to ego. 

Get belief in yourself au fur est à mesure que tu grandis réussi tes objectifs. 
Belief in oneself came from achievement. Mais tjr rester modeste. 

Self estem made without work and succeed; give and promote but adulte without back up make us weak.

Be able to evaluate your own ability. Be self aware. 

Think big, act and live small. Long term!!! Iteration 

#### talk talk talk 
Talk is weak and cheap. 
Take action, go into that uncomfortable zone of uncertainty. 

Verbalizing to much confuse our mind, tricking it into thinking the job is done. So talk less about your plan and take action. 


#### to be or to do? 
Do you want to be somebody or to do something?
Having authority diferent than being authority. 
Having the right is distinct than being right. 

Nation is born stoic and die epicurean. 

Its about the doing, not the recognition. 
Ask yourself : 
Does it help me do what I have set out to do? 
Does it allow me to do what I need to do? 
Am I being selfish or selfless? 
What is it thst I want to accomplish in life? 


One man to be insipire is Boyd. 

#### become a student
Dude that joined Metallica as guitar take guitar courses after joining. 

Studious self assessment everyday cause we always have so much to learn. 

Plus, minus and equal technique:
Plus : have a person to learn for
Minus : have a person to teach to 
Equal : have an equal to be challenge by

"it is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already know"

Take feedback 

When student is ready, the teacher appears. 

#### dont be passionate 
- [ ] Relire se chapitre 
Reason > to passion. 

One great coach of basket was described as "dispassionate". His philosophy was about being in control. 

Need purpose and realism (more important). 

*surtout pas trop de zèle* to stop being that good intentioned person and ineffective self. 

#### follow the canvas strategy 
- [ ] Relire se chapitre


Greatness come from humble beginning, it comes from grunt work. It mean you're the past important person in the room. 

Be lesser, do more. 

Imagine if every person you meet you think of a way to help them. That benefit them and not you. Think about what you can do for them. 
That give you a lot of friend who own you a favor. 
It is the idea of the canvas strategy : short term gratification for long term strategy. 

Let other take credit of your actionand be glad they took it. Because you defer and earn interest on the principal. 

#### restrain yourself 
Have self control, stay calm, self possess, patient and polite. 

Your own path will be in some way define by the amount of non-sense we are willing do deal with. 

It doesn't degrade you when other treat you poorly, it degrade them. 

Can change the system after you have made it. 

#### get out of your own head 
- [ ] add Alan watts citation

Platon talk about the mistake of "feasting on their own thoughts". 

Our imagination is an asset but dangerous when it runs wild.

There is no one to perform for. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us. 

#### the danger of early pride 
Pride is a sin because it is a lie, that convince people that they are better than God made them. Pride lead to arrogance. 

What a pitiful thing it is when a man lets a little temporary succes spoil him, warp is jugement and he forget what he is. 

Genghis khan : "if you can't swallow your pride, you can't lead. "

Protect yourself against the validation and gratification. 

Question to ask when feel pride:
- What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see
- What I am avoiding or running from with my bluster, frantic eds and embellishments? 
It is far better to ask and answer these question now. 

Privately thinking you are better than other is still pride and dangerous. 

"That on wich you so pride yourself will be your ruin. You who think yourself to be someone"

Dont boast. There is nothing in it for you. 


#### work work work 
Having an idea is not enough, you need to work. 
We just need the humbleness to be patient.
Ego want the hour we spend planing to be paid well. 


#### For everything that commes next, ego is the enemy... 
Ego give us excuses. 
Be ambitious in your aims and accept that in the path you will make plenty of mistakes. 
- [ ] revoir 


## part 2 
#### success 
Why is succes so ephemeral? Ego shortens it. Cause we stop learning, listening, we lose our grasp of what matter. 
Also practice gratitude. 

Why empire seem to always colapse from within? 

#### always stay a student
Gengis khans learn the best of each culture. 
The more you known, the more your ignorance grow.

Someone trully humble observe and listen. 

Understand how you learn and set uip process to accelerate it. 

#### dont tell yourself a story
> myth become myth not in the living but in the retelling. (David Maraniss)

Bill Walsh, best NFL coach  implemented a "standard of performance". That is what should be done. When. How. 
It's about installing excellence. 
Cause if the player take care of the detail, the score take care of itself. 

Cause you didn't know it would happen, you think, you believe it could happen. 

Focus on the task at hand, not in the story. 

It's important to keep the high standard so the story quit your mind. Also it's when you win that you need it the most, to learn, improve, listen and get feedback. 

There is no "haha moment" or sudden moment of clarity / envision, it's habit that build the success.

"The way to do big think seems to start with deceptively small think."

Start with iterative scale and small bet. 

There is danger in label especially the one such as "genius". 

#### what is important for you 
Story of Grant and Sherman. Grant ended up failing all he try to do latter cause he didn't know what he wants.

Use your time to do something you like. 

Know who you are competiting with and why. 

Idea of the Greek word *euthymia* (Seneca), stay in your path. 

Ego reject trade off. Life require trade off that ego refuse. Like being opera and pop icone. 

> why do you do what you do

Find why you are after what you are after.

#### entitlement, control and paranoia
> one of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important - bertrand russell

Achieving succès mean gaining against all odd, taking a lot of risk, athletic victory... 

Control say it must be done my ways even little think, it become perfectionism. And this exhaust you, you waste energy. 

Paranoia, you can't trust people. 
And you lose energy trying to manipulate and get rid of imaginary coup d'état against you. 


#### Managing yourself
> It is not enough to have great qualities; we should also have the management of them. La Rochefoucauld. 

Learn to manage yourself before learning to manage other. 
- [ ] revoir 

#### beware the disease of me
> if I am not for myself who will be for me? If I am only for myself, who I am? 

Great team tends to follow a trajectory, at the start a team is innocent. If the conditions are right, the team come together, watch out for each other and work together. This stage is call the innocent climb. 

Then the team win and get media attention. 
Then ego appear. And the disease of me emerge. 

Ego need honor in orther to be validate, confidence is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition.
Example : Marshal did not take the offer of being in charge of the DDay, letting the best man for the job Eisenhower doing it. 


Be magnanimous, even with the one that hurt you during your climb. 

Who has time to look at picture of yourself? 
Time spent with marketing and media is time lost to your task. 

Who care about the credit? 
Think about the life of Marshal. 

#### meditate on the immensity
> a monk is a man who is separated from all and who is in harmony with all
> - Evagrius Poncticus

Sympatheia - state of connectedness with the cosmos (stoism). Sense of belonging to something larger.

This state help us answer questions such as : who I am, what I'm doing, what is my role? 

Ego tell us that being at the center of attention is the way. 

So find something bigger than you, find your lighthouse.

Go into the wild, the nature to think and get inspired. Also to relax. 

> it's hard to be humble when you are as great as I am
> - Muhammad Ali

Remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to one-up those around you. 

Realise how much come before you. And let this feeling carry you.

#### maintain your sobriety
> the height of ciiltivation runs to simplicity  
> - Bruce Lee

Sober like Angela Merkel, be modest, plain, care little for flash it presentation. Give no fierce speech, have no interest in expension or domination. 
Stay quiet and reserve.
- [ ] read again and note on the philosopher. 

> You can't solve task with charisma
> - Angela Merkel 

Sobriety of ego. 


#### for what come next, ego is the enemy...
> the evidence is in, and you are the verdict. 
> Anne Lamott

Napoléon said 
> man of great ambition have sought happiness... But have found fame. 

It mean being every goal is the drive to be happy and fulfilled. 
However, when egoism take hold, we lost track of our goal and end up somewhere else we never intended to. 

Howard Hughes had a reputation of a bold maverick. However on his death bed, he admit not liking his life. 

### part 3 

#### Failure 
We need purpose, poise and patience.


- [ ] note George Goodman thought on economic crisis and métaphore with golden ball 

Gilgamesh :
> he will face a battle he knows not 
> he will ride a road he knows not

One of the most formidable CEO, Graham the CEO of Washington Post. Had a decade and half of "batheme de feu" the make the company to the SPC 500.

> to see yourself as more than you are and to value yourself at less than your true worth. 
> Goethe 

When face difficulty, ego show it true color. 
Will ego betray you ? Will ego say I know you couldn't do it ? 
Ego will say **it is someone else problem**, and ego will try to wash your hand of it. Ego will also add self injury. 

Humbe and strong people will feel difficulty with stoic, and cheerfull resilience. 
Cause they can get without validation. 

==what matter is that we can respond to what life throws at us==


#### alive time or dead time? 
> vivre sans temps mort
> slogan parisien

Malcom X go to prison and read book for 7 years, it's what is call Alive time. Time us to gain/improve    

In hard situation it would be easier and make you feel better to just be angry, depressed heartbroken... But this is shortsighted. 
Instead think and said : "this is q' opportunity for me, I can us that for my purpose. I will not let this be dead time for me".


#### the effort is enough
> what matters to an active man is to do the right thing; whether the right thing comes to pass should not bother him 
> - Goethe

Story of Belisarius. 
Just like him, many people will not be appreciate for they work. They will do invention ahead of their time. 
And ego will tell you, Should they have not done it?? 

There is think in your control and not. 
The less attached to the outcome, the better. 
Fulfill your self with your own standards.

The expectation hangover, being praised and paid. It's only for the ego and both doesn't always go together. 

Exemple of Alexander and Diogenes encounter. With can't let praise and impressment motivate us. 

*this too, can bear - I still*
*Am Belisarius!*


Change your definition of succes, succes is peace of mind. Success is the result of self satisfaction knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best.

Do your work, do it well. Then let go and let God. 

#### Fight club moments
> if you shut up truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow, and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it burst through it will blow up everything in its way. 
> - Émile Zola

All people experience rock bottom, like Tyler who have his flat burn by Tailor. Going down force us to fasse all the unhealthy and ego derived state of our life. 
The bigger the ego, the harder the fall. 

Fight club moment are catalys for changes we where petrified to make. 

These kind of momen are defined by three traits :
1. They almost always came at the hands of some outside force or person. 
2. They often involved things we already knew about ourselves, but where too scare to admit. 
3. From the ruin came the opportunity got great progress and improvement. 

Careful cause ego may block the opportunity and growth. 

Turning away from true only decay the fall. And the more we wait, the more deadly the fall is. 

The feeling after rock bottom is one of the most powerful perspectives in the world. 

#### Draw the line
> it can ruin your life only if it ruins your character
> Marc Aurelius

Some people associate their business and entrepreneurship with their person. As who they are. And let good life and good money fighting for a lost cause. 
We take risk, and we mess up. 
That's life. 

Have the courage to make a full stop. 

Shit happen, and shit happen in public too. Are you going to make it worst? 
Or emerge with dignity and character intact? 

Most trouble are temporary. 
Recovery is one step after the other. 

He who fear failure will never do anything worthy of a man. 

If your reputation can't absorbe a few blow, it wasn't worth anything in the first place. 

#### Maintain your own scorecard
> I never look back, except to find out about mistakes... I only see danger in thinking back about things you are proud of. 
> Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann

Make a distinction between your inner scoreboard and the external one. 
Maintaint yourself to your own standard.
Think about the story of Brady (Football player). 

It's not about you can get away with, it's about if you should or shouldn't do. 

Our view of our action are partiate. Especially when they shouldn't. Like when we are about to act, the eagerness of passion may make true reflection and impartiality hard. 

We have to be the indifferent spectator. A guide to judge our behavior. 

Hold your action against a standard, and bab grey area or no one will know. 

À person that hold himself to his own standards doesn't crave for the spotlight the same way plus he is less selfish and self absorbed.

Go with discipline 


#### Always love
> and why should we feel anger at the world? 
> as if the world will notice
> - Euripides

Story of Hearst an ultra rich American who want to destroy a movie that he think was a critic of him.
Instead of hate, use love. 
Have love for that bastard. 
Or if you can't, let it go. Shake your head and laugh about it. 

Where have hated and rage get anyone anywhere? 

Are we going to be miserable just because other people are? 


##### For everything that comes next, ego is the enemy 
> I don't like work - no man does - buy I like what is in the work - the chance to find yourself
>  - Joseph Conrad

*not to aspire or seek out if ego.*
*to have success without ego.*
*to push through failure with strength, not ego.*

#### Epilogue
> There is something of a civil war going on within all of our lives. There is a recalcitrant South of our soul revolting against the North of our soul. And there is this continual struggle within the very structure of every individual life. 
> - Martin Luther King Jr. 

Training is like sweeping the floor, just because we've done it once, doesn't mean the floor is clean forever. 

Karma for bad behavior can be the illness of ego (paranoia, failed relationships...)

Any fool can learn from experience, the trick is to learn form other's people experience.
