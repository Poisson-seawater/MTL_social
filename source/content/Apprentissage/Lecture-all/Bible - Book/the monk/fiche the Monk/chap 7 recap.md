###### intro
Présentation of [[Shivana Wisdom Fable]] et sa version [plus courte].
Et 1er concept fondamental: **mind control** - the garden.


### Garden 
###### GOAL
Ancien technique for mind control
SO YOU CAN erase the habit of habit of worry
AND love yourself (which allow you to truly love other).

###### WHY
**WHY it matter:** Mind management is the essence of life management.
**BECAUSE**: Think are create twice;
- first in the workshop of the mind
- and then, and only then, in reality.
	- HENCE (*boucle*): take control of your though and take control of the blueprint for the reality.

-> [[_Life Heritage|Clarity]]


### Learn form pain
To transcend pain, you must first experience it.
- Or to put it another way, how can you really know the joy of being on the summit of the mountain unless you have first visited the lowest valley every event offers you lessons. 
- These little lessons fuel your inner and outer growth. 
	- Without them, you would be stuck on a plateau.

There are no mistakes in life nor positive or negative experience, only lessons, opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery


> Take for habit of searching for positive in every situation.
