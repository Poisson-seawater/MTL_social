	- If I fear something, then I should do it. 


##### On improving yourself
When you improve yourself, you are improving the lives of all those around you. And when you have the courage to advance confidently in the direction of your dreams, you begin to draw upon the power of the universe (cause Universe want you to improve -> improve around you).

##### On Failure
Failure is not having the courage to try, nothing more and nothing less.
- The teachers of the East say that every arrow that hits the bull’s eye is the result of one hundred misses. 
	- It is a fundamental Law of Nature to profit through loss. 
	- Never fear failure. Failure is your friend.”

##### Character
Character is higher than intellect. A great soul will be strong to live as well as to think.’ Your character is built when you act in a way that corresponds with the principles I’ve just mentioned. If you fail to do this, true happiness will always elude you.”
