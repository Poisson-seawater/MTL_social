Like a wire cable, tiny habit and self discipline make you stronger. Willpower and discipline are like a wire cable - made of multiple tiny and fragile cable-, it's the some of them that create them tougher than Iron
All by tiny act in the [[Power Of Habit|routine]] and self discipline.

> the lack of willpower is a mental disease.
> Whereas **Self control** give you ==energy==!! 


Words are the verbal embodiement of power. 

Don't race against other race against yourself. 


> Through the steel of discipline, you will forge a character rich with courage and peace. 
> Through the virtue of will, you are destined to rise to life’s highest ideal and live within a heavenly mansion filled with all that is good, joyful and vital. Without them, you are lost like a mariner without a compass, one who eventually sinks with his ship.

**satori**, meaning instant awakening; like a deep conversation that will change your life. 



###### Goals setting :
The tricks is to keep setting the mark higher and raising one's standards continuously.
Which will release that magical quality of momentum that will motivate you to keep exploring your infinite potential. (see Power of momentum)
-> [[Atomic Habit - Note de lecture]]




###### Willpower training
Remember: Wisdom without proper tools for its application is no wisdom at all. -> so train willpower!!
(*think about Psycho Pass, the hero train his body as strong as his gun*)
Then use your will power to change your bad habits.

1st, one mantra to receite: 
- "I am more than I appear to be, all the world’s strength and power rests inside me."

 - do it while envisonning yourself, or meditating

2nd: start your day by doing what you don't like. 

3rd: do day of silence. Just answer direct question. 
IDEA: *by keeping silent for a day, you are conditioning your will to do as you command it to do. Each time the urge to speak arises, you actively curb this impulse and remain quiet. You realize, your will does not have a mind of its own. It waits for you to give it instructions that will spur it into action. The more control you exert over it, the more powerful it will become. The problem is that most people don’t use their willpower.”*

All those exercice to: ==Use willpower on a regular basis== (*it's hard, and demand to fight the easy path*)

-> REMEMBER: For life and willpower, Small victories lead to large victories.

###### Positive always overcomes negative.
So if you continue to wage war against the weaker thoughts that might have silently crept into the palace of your mind over the years (*like I will do it tomorrow or it's too late for me*), eventually they will see that they are unwanted and leave like visitors who know they are not welcome.”

> “When you control your thoughts, you control your mind.
>  When you control your mind, you control your life. 
> And once you reach the stage of being in total control of your life, you become the master of your destiny.”

When feel like going back to old habit, remember positive always overcome negative. 
By battleling again the weak voice in my head, they will leave when they understand they are not welcome
