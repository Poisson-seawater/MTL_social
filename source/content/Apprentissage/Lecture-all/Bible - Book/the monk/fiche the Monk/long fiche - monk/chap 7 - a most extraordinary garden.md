Master the art of loving yourself so you can truly love other. 

#### At the heart of sivanna system,
7 fundamental principles that embodied the keys to self leadership, personal responsibility and spiritual enlightenment. 

###### Memo way to [[Shivana Wisdom Fable]]
Find a beautiful **garden** with gorgeous **rose**. In the middle of the garden, a 6 stage red **lighthouse**.  
Then the door open and a huge Japanese **sumo** **wrestler** goes out of it. 
He only wore a **pink wire cable** to cover his genitals.
As he walk on the garden he felt on a **stopwatch**.  He lay that way for a moment and then finally he woke up, and agily get back on his feet. 
At his feet, he see a **winding path of diamonds**. 


## Garden
The garden is a symbol for the mind, of you culticate your mind, just a a garden. It will blosson far beyond expectations. 
- To live life to the fullest, you must stand guard at the gate of your garden and let only the very best information enter. 
	- You truly cannot afford the luxury of a negative thought — not even one. such as worry, anxiety, fretting about the past, brooding over the futur or self created fear. 
- Sages taught that on an average day the average person runs about sixty thousand thoughts through his mind. And ninety-five percent of those thoughts were the same as the ones you thought the day before!”
- "There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. From struggle comes strength. Even pain can be a wonderful teacher."
	- To transcend pain, you must first experience it. Or to put it another way, how can you really know the joy of being on the summit of the mountain unless you have first visited the lowest valley
	- very event offers you lessons. These little lessons fuel your inner and outer growth. Without them, you would be stuck on a plateau.

So don't allow toxic waste in the garden, such as worry, anxiety, fretting about the past, brooding over the futur or self created fear. 
Mind management is the essence of life management. 
In Sivanna written language, worry is close to funeral. 
Take for habit of searching for positive in every situation. 
There is no positive or negative experience, there is only lesson in every events. 

Begin to live out of the glory of my imagination, not my memory. 

Mind need exercise!!! 

"the boundary of my life are merely creations of the self"

Persistence is the key!!!! 

Concentration is the root of mental Mastery. 
Focus your mind on one purpose. -> get clarity !!!
- concentration is like a **magnifying glass** ignating a fire.

> the secret of happiness is simple: find out what you truly love to do and then direct all of your energy towards doing it. *Once you do this, abundance flows into your life and all your desires are filled with ease and grace.*
> - we sleep to much cause nothing better to do -> see concept of "energy leak"
> - this passion must be of use to the word


Find you passion that improve or serve the lives of other, and direct all your energy to it. 
Silently contemplate:
- where I was, and
- where I am going. 

Take 10min of reflection a day. 

Practice the heart of the [[Coeur de la rose|rose]] technique daily. Do it few time a day, but every time do it are the same place, cause their is power in ritual. 

Think are create twice: first in the workshop of the mind and then, and only then, in reality. -> so take control of your though and take control of the blueprint for the reality.
- the price of greatness is responsibility over each of your thoughts. - Churchill.
	- -> have to muscle the mind !!
- If you want to live a more peaceful, meaningful life, you must think more peaceful, meaningful thoughts.”


One must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind him to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle — and a mystery.


Care for my though as it is my most precious prized possession. 
Only keep positive and pure though, repeat positive affirmation or mantras and read book rich with wisdom. 

For the most part, fatigue is a creation of the mind. **Fatigue dominates the lives of those who are living without direction and dreams.** Your interest and mental focus give you energy.

> The Sages of Sivana firmly believed that one should only think sattvic or pure thoughts. 
> -  If even one impure thought entered the temple of their minds they would punish themselves by travelling many miles to an imposing waterfall and standing under the ice-cold water until they could no longer bear the frigid temperature.”
> 	- A worrisome thought is like an embryo: it starts off small but grows and grows. Soon it takes on a life of its own


For God’s sake, never get into the petty habit of measuring your self-worth against other people’s net worth. Every second you spend thinking about someone else’s dreams you take time away from your own.
