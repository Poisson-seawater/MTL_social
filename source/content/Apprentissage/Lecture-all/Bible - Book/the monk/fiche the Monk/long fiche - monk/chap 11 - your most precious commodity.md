"If youth only knew, if age only could." -> cause for most people by the time they find what they want, it's too late for them ...

What separates those who build exceptional lives from the ‘also rans’ is the way they use this time.”

The busiest people are the one that succed in finding time. Moral of the story, learn to manage your time. 

Take 15min at night to organize your day. And 1h every Sunday to organize your week. 

In the planning,
- add your personal, 
- social and spiritual development goal of the week. 


Focus time around priority. 
-> If too busy, follow the 80/20 law. 
-> failing to plan is planning to fail. By writing down not only your appointments with others but also those all-important appointments with yourself to read, relax or write a love letter to your wife, you will be far more productive with your time. 
-> Never forget that time spent enriching your non-work hours is never a waste. It makes you tremendously efficient during your working hours.


> Enlightened people are priority driven. 
> follow the 80/20 law; always follow it !! 



==Be ruthless with your time, learn to say no.== 
-> Don’t pick up the phone every time it rings. It is there for your convenience, not the convenience of others. Ironically, people will respect you more when they see that you are a person who values his time. They will realize that your time is precious and they will value it.”

those who are masters of their time live simple lives. A hurried, frenzied pace is not what nature intended. While he firmly believed that lasting happiness could be reached only by those who were effective and set definite aims for themselves, living a life rich with accomplishment and contribution did not have to come through the sacrifice of peace of mind.


Stop acting like you are going to live 500 more years. 
- The best time to plant a tree was 20y ago, the 2nd best time is today. 
- **SO** Develop a **deathbed** mentality. 
	- The idea is savour today as it could be your last day on earth. Ask your self, what would I do if today was my last day on earth?? 
- HENCE: Act as if failure is impossible.

The only thing you can take with you to the end of your life is your conscience. Listen to your conscience.  And serve the Word.
