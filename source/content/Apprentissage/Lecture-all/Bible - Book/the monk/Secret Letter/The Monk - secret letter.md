Authenticity, allumet is a coin with a hole in it. Having moon and sun face, like yin and yang . To think of who I am?? And how much authentic I get, through my layer and story telling.

Live without fear, fight then by doing what you fear. Link to the the concept of half step vs full step. Do what you fear. Allumet is a skull.

Kindness, is one of the grease of life. Live and breath through and with it.

Small steps, take care of routine in the Miyamoto ways.
