- [ ] #_ToDo_/urgent : put into habit, add in [[_Routine|routine]] and make it more pleasant for the eyes !! 
-> [[how to do planning]]

One way to do your goals is:
- Every morning when wake up, picture your goal 
	- if you fail to succed, punish yourself in a way that train your resilience and mental strenght. Instead of just watch netflix.
- Do a pledge, tell people you care about it. 
	- to create positive pressure to keep on !!
- Never set a goal without puting a time line on it. + a goal that is not committed to paper is not a goal at all. 
	- dream book
- The magic rule of 21, for new behavior to crystallize into habit you have to perform the new habit 21 days in a row. 
- Finally: enjoy the process
	- have passion for life. Reclaim the joy of waking up every morning full of energy and exhilaration. Breathe the fire of passion into all that you do. You will quickly reap great material, as well as spiritual, rewards
	- Every experience offers lessons. So stop majoring in minor things. Enjoy your life.
	- Reminder : a day without laughter and or love is a day without life. 
		- If you can’t laugh at yourself who can you laugh at?


###### Note from the 10 chapter's of "the monk who sold his ferrari"
The tricks is to keep setting the mark higher and raising one's standards continuously.
Which will release that magical quality of momentum that will motivate you to keep exploring your infinite potential. (see Power of momentum)
