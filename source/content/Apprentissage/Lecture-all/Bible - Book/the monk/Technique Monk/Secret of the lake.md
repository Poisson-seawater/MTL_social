Monk explanation of the law of attraction.  ET ma fiche recap de la loi de l'attraction


**Meditation name**: Secret of the Lake
###### HOW it work
The mind works through pictures. 
- Pictures affect your self-image 
- and your self-image affects the way you feel, act and achieve. 
- HENCE if your self-image isn't on the same page as your goal-> can't achieve these goals.
	- SO master it -> [[_Life Heritage|Clarity]]

Spend some time every day (*another principle for enlightened living*), even if it is just a few minutes, in the practice of creative envisioning. 
- See yourself as you want to be, whether this means serving as a great judge, a great father or a great citizen of your community.”
- -> can practice in living room.
- DO IT every day, even just a few minute in the practice of creative envisioning.

###### WHY it matter,
“When you run inspiring, imaginative pictures through the movie screen of your mind, wonderful things start to happen in your life.
- ‘imagination is more important than knowledge.’ - Einstein

IF your self-image tells you impossibility, THEN you never will achieve these goals & this prophecy will ultimately become your reality.
