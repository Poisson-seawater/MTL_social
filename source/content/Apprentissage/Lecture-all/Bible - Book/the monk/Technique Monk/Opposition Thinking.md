>[!info] Technique to get rid of negativity, negative thought or undesirable thought at any time.

**WHY**: to protect our garden -> [[MONK resum.canvas|MONK resum]]

**HOW it work**: the mind can only hold one thought at any time. 

Using this little-known information, anyone can easily create a positive, creative mindset within a short period. 
The process is straightforward:
- when an undesirable thought occupies the focal point of your mind, immediately replace it with an uplifting one. 
- It’s as if your mind is a giant slide projector, with every thought in your mind being a slide. 
	- Whenever a negative slide comes up on the screen, take swift action to replace it with a positive one.
