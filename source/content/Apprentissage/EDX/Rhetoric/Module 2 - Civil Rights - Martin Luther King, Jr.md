# Module 2 - Civil Rights - Martin Luther King, Jr

###### Goal
- Locate the parts of the dispositio of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech.
- Describe the historical context of the speech.
- Describe the importance of audience and setting to the crafting of a speech.
- Describe where and how the modes of appeal are used in a speech.
- Explain the use and impact of allusion, anaphora, and metaphor in a speech, and begin to recognize their use in other speeches.
- Define and identify examples of alliteration, assonance, and sibilance.
  
  

#### **Introduction**
The introduction of a piece of writing can take many forms, but it has three primary jobs to do:
- break the silence, 
- name the subject, 
- and engage interest and attention.

  
  
###### **Breaking the Silence**
This function of the introduction is most important in an oral presentation: you must greet your audience in a way that befits the situation. 

In this module we have seen Martin Luther King Jr. do so in the most succinct and simple way: “I am happy to join with you today. . . “

Sometimes, however, the space devoted to the greeting will require more detail. This is most often true when there are credentials necessary to identify you as a qualified speaker. At such times, an appeal to _ethos_ is a good strategy for establishing yourself at the outset as a speaker or writer worthy of your audience’s time.

Classical scholars of rhetoric called this opening ethical appeal _insinuatio_. It is important to approach it with care: boasting will win you few favors with an audience. In fact, an appeal to personal experience can often be as powerful as an appeal to expertise. For example, when Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm spoke out in the House of Representatives against increased military spending in 1969, she began her second sentence thus:

“As a teacher, and as a woman, I do not think I will ever understand what kind of values can be involved in spending $9 billion—and more, I am sure—on elaborate, unnecessary, and impractical weapons…”

  
  

###### **Naming the Subject**

How much of what you have to say should you reveal from the very beginning? The answer depends on your audience, your topic, and the conventions of the forum in which you write or speak.

If you took a college class on composition, you were probably urged to give your thesis in full in your introduction, offering a “roadmap” for the argument. But this is by no means the only way to open a composition! Sometimes, merely naming the occasion of the piece will be all your audience needs to know what you are going to be talking about. At other times, you might want to open with a question, withholding your answer until later.

  
  
###### **Engaging the Audience**

This is perhaps the most challenging aspect of any introduction. There are many strategies for getting your audience’s attention. A few of the most common include:

1. Open with a question,
	1. and tell why the answer to that question matters.
2. Open with a refutation: 
	1. someone—or everyone—has misunderstood your subject, and you have come to set things right.
3. Open with a story: 
	1. often called a “hook,” the opening anecdote is one of the most tried-and-true ways of opening a composition.

  
  

#### **Statement of Fact**
As Professor Engell pointed out, in the “I have a dream” speech, Martin Luther King Jr. needs spend little time on his _narratio._ His listeners already know well the injustices that have inspired them to protest.

At other times, however, the "facts" are not merely context: they speak for themselves, or can be made so to speak by vivid description. In requesting an indictment of a suspect accused of murder, for example, detailing the alleged crimes in all their most lurid details may help a prosecutor influence the jury even before coming to the proofs of guilt that he or she may have to offer.

###### **Argument**
In supporting your argument, you will likely have to make a series of points. Each should be supported by clear pieces of evidence, and each should be clearly connected to the preceding and following claims.

In the speech we read for this module, we saw King make a series of distinct claims: that the Founding Fathers had made a promise of equality and freedom, that the nation had defaulted on that promise, that the need to fulfill that promise was urgent and immediate, that the action taken to demand its fulfillment must be nonviolent, and that his listeners must never give up.

  
  

###### **Counterargument**
The _refutatio_ is your opportunity to anticipate the objections of your opponents and the doubts and questions of your allies. Where and how you do so depends both on your thesis and on the nature of your topic. For example, if you take an unconventional or controversial position or if you are primarily responding to another writer or speaker, you may wish to begin as early as the introduction with a refutation before you set about giving your alternative view.

On another occasion, you may find yourself already on a strong footing with your audience, needing only to rebuke detractors or clear up misunderstandings and misgivings. Thus King, for example, needs mainly to warn his opponents—“those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content”—that he and his supporters will not be easily dissuaded, and to advise the weary among his listeners—“fresh from narrow jail cells”—that their suffering will be worthwhile in the end. The former _refutatio_ he makes merely in passing, and with the latter he closes the main body of his speech.

###### **Peroration**

The peroration of a speech can be nothing more than a summation, but it can also be so much more: a stirring call to action on the claims you have made, a prediction of the future success of your cause, an invocation of respected predecessors, a vivid image, or a personal anecdote in closing. King’s _peroratio_ is all of these and more. It takes up easily a third of his address, departing from the script and even breaking into song.

  
  

#### First draw :
1. Identify modes of appeal that would be useful for persuading your readers. Are there "non-artistic" modes of appeal that would help make your point, like statistics, examples, or testimony? Do you need to work out from that evidence to your conclusion? Or work through the logical relationship of two or three statements you have posited? Should you appeal to the emotions of your audience in some way? How can you establish your expertise, integrity, or knowledge of the topic?


2. Think for a moment about the structure and style of your argument. Would you need a lengthy introduction, or will your audience be familiar with your topic? Are there important counterarguments to address? What kind of style would suit your argument? Should you try to keep things clear and simple, or should you reach for technical terms or poetic language?
    
3. Consider the rhetorical devices we have covered in this module: allusion, anaphora, metaphor, alliteration, assonance, and sibilance. Could any of these enhance your message?
