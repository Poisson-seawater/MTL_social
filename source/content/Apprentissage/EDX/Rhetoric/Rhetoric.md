###### Rhetoric
  Classical rhetoric—and rhetoric today, too—is divided into three types:  
- **Judicial rhetoric**  (or "forensic") means discussion of a past action to evaluate whether or not it was just.
- **Deliberative** (or "legislative") refers to rhetoric intended to persuade. E
- **Epideictic rhetoric** ("ceremonial" or "demonstrative") is used to either celebrate or blame an individual--eulogies, for example, would fall under this category.
