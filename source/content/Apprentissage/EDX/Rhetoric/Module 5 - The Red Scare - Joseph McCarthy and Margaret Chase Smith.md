###### GOAL
- dentify the modes of appeal and the logical reasoning of the featured speeches.
- dentify both common and special topics used in these speeches.
- Identify examples from these speeches of logical fallacies.
- Discuss the importance of winning and keeping an audience's trust, and the pros and cons of attempting to tear down their confidence in your opponent.
- Write your own definition of "extremist rhetoric," and debate its use as a political tool.
- Consider the moral responsibilities of those who would seek to persuade others through language.


  
## [[Logical Fallacy|Logical fallacies]]

Whether we are making arguments or hearing them, we must be aware of the ways that they can go wrong. There are errors both of fact and of formal logic that can cause a line of reasoning to fall apart under closer inspection.

We call such problems in logical reasoning "fallacies," and they take three primary forms: 
- **fallacies of fact**
- **fallacies of reasoning**, 
- and **context-dependent fallacies**.



#### **Fallacies of Fact**

A fallacy of fact is simply an untruth or falsehood, whether deliberate or unintended, in the examples or premises of an argument.

We will not spend much time in this course discussing fallacies of fact, because they are problems of the content rather than the form of a discourse. However, it is critical that you work to avoid them by making sure that you use reputable sources for your factual claims. Then to defend your arguments from charges of “fake news,” you will want to make judicious use of the topics of testimony and statistics so that it will be clear from the beginning that your assertions are grounded in truth. Finally, be sure to clearly cite those sources!

Similarly, when you are in the audience, one of your first responses should be to question the argument’s underlying assertions and assumptions. You should always be ready to ask, "Where does this information come from? What inaccuracies might it have?" and, "Are its sources trustworthy?"

Lastly, beware of the half-truth: information that is true, but partial, leaving out key facts that matter to the question at hand. This kind of fallacy of fact can be the most difficult to detect, and it is why you should always double-check an argument’s premises, even when they appear to be well founded.

  
  

###### **Inductive Fallacies**

We have already discussed some of the ways that inductive reasoning can go wrong. Most of them fall into the first of these two categories:

  
  

###### **Faulty Generalization**

A faulty generalization is a problem in moving from a particular example to a larger claim. To have bearing on a case, each rhetorical example must be analogous to that case, and the conclusion must suit the representativeness of the examples.

_I couldn’t seem to get good grades in my statistics course. I must just be bad at math._

_Our Olympic swim team didn’t win a single medal this year. I’m sure the gymnasts won’t do well either._

  
  

###### **Slippery Slope**

The “slippery slope” fallacy suggests that one action or event must inevitably lead to a whole sequence of related events. Now, the slippery slope argument may have some truth in it. Without establishing a direct causal link, however, it is impossible to say what will happen for certain.

  
  

_If we legalize marijuana, it won’t be long before there are shops selling heroin on every corner!_

_Don’t let yourself have that cookie! Pretty soon you’ll be completely out of shape._

  
  

#### **Deductive Fallacies**
In our unit on deductive reasoning, we discussed some of the ways that a syllogistic argument can be invalid. Most of these are fairly easy to detect. They occur when, for whatever reason, the principle articulated in the major premise does not apply to the case covered in the minor premise.

There are, however, two additional kinds of syllogistic fallacies we should cover here:

  

###### **Equivocation**

To equivocate in deductive reasoning is to change your terms halfway through. This is most likely to happen when a word means two things, or when two concepts are similar but have a key difference:

_The new study shows that sleep is essential to good health. Therefore, you must take naps in order to be healthy._

_Professor Hamilton’s website says that he teaches a class on Marxist literary theory. Marxists are dangerous communists and shouldn’t be teaching our children._

  
  

###### **Either/or Fallacy**

The either/or fallacy involves insisting on a binary opposition of terms when, in fact, there are multiple options.

_Either you’re in favor of these new rent-control policies or you’re supporting the very worst kind of gentrification._

_There are really only two options: appeasement and war_.

  
  

##### **Faulty Causal Associations**

Faulty causal associations can be made in either deductive or inductive lines of reasoning. Whenever we assume without proof that an event was caused by one particular cause out of multiple possible causes, then we have created a fallacy.

  
In a deductive argument, we might detect such a fallacy by articulating it as a syllogism:

_If our opponents' Olympic team takes illegal performance-enhancing drugs, they may win the weight-lifting event._

_Our opponents' team won the weightlifting event._

_Therefore, they must have taken performance-enhancing drugs._

  
  

In an inductive argument, we might improperly apply an example by judging a cause without adequate proof:

_The last time I used this fishing pole, I won the fishing tournament. The fish must really like this brand of pole!_


#### **Context-Dependent Fallacies**
Some fallacies are dependent on the context of the discourse: the audience, the interlocutor or opponent, and the back-and-forth of discussion.

##### **Argument ad Hominem**
The argument ad hominem is the fallacy of making a personal attack on your interlocutor instead of answering his or her argument. Though it fails to address the interlocutor's logic or evidence, it can often still be persuasive because it affects the other person's ethos and hence his or her credibility.

_We shouldn’t take Senator McDowell’s foreign-policy proposals seriously. She couldn’t even keep her hotel company from going out of business_.

_Mr. Olson is just another undereducated bumpkin from the country—we can’t trust his opinion on healthcare reform._

  
  

##### **Straw Man**

Like the argument ad hominem, the “straw man” argument is a diversion: it is the tactic of misrepresenting someone’s argument to make it easier to counter.

_Do you really think Mr. Anderson is qualified for this engineering position? His degree is in sociology!_

_How can you say that sociology isn't important? The humanities and social sciences teach critical-thinking skills that our society badly needs!_

##### **Argument ad Populum**

The argument ad populum takes two primary forms: either an appeal to something “everybody knows,” or the use of charged words that play on emotional or historical associations that will resonate with the audience without necessarily being grounded in fact. Though either approach does not necessarily hold water, it is often still persuasive, since it can involve a powerful appeal to pathos.

_Everybody knows that free-trade policies are the only way to bring about economic growth._

_Patriotism is just Nazism in disguise._

  
  

##### **Leading or Complex Question**

The leading question involves some tacit, contestable assumption. To answer the question as it was asked, the other person will have to admit the truth of the question’s premise:

_When did you stop cheating on your exams?_
