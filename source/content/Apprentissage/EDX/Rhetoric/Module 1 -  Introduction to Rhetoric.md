###### GOAL
- Define the term "rhetoric."
- Articulate the importance of effective communication.
- Summarize the history of rhetorical study, from the ancient Greeks to the modern day.
- Identify the parts of a discourse.
- Identify tropes and schemes, and explain their use in composition.
- Choose a topic and brainstorm ideas for the op-ed assignment.


###### Substance
substance—that is, the idea you are trying to communicate or the point you are trying to prove. This can usually be summed up in a **thesis**: the statement of your argument in a single, declarative sentence.

Once you can state your idea in its simplest terms, you are ready to build an argument around it.

_Democracy is the ideal form of governement_

#### **The Modes of Appeal**
Since Aristotle, rhetoricians have identified **three primary modes of appeal** that we may use to persuade an audience.


##### Logos
**Logos,** “appeal” to reason : _Democracy always promotes the best interests of the majority of people in any decision because everyone in the group can advocate for their interests, and decisions are made by majority consensus_.

###### Deductive reasoning
**Deductive reasoning** : makes one or more propositions and then works through their logical implications. We can understand deductive reasoning by putting it in the form of a syllogism, which is a series of statements that make each proposition explicit:

_In a democracy, decisions are made by majority consensus._

_While a consensus is being worked out, each person will be able to advocate for his or her own interests._

_Therefore, decisions in a democracy will reflect the interests of the majority of the people._

###### Inductive reasoning
**inductive reasoning** makes probable conclusions from examples or pieces of evidence.

_Democracy is good for the overall success of a country; many of the most powerful and prosperous nations in the world are ruled by democratic governments._


##### Ethos
- **Ethos** ; the “ethical appeal,” which is based on establishing the credibility of the speaker or writer (to include both, we may speak of the “rhetor”). Ethos is often deployed indirectly: (like a logo)
    

_In fifty years of studying the governments of nations on every continent, I have found that the more democratic the government, the happier the people._


##### Pathos
- **Pathos** ; the appeal to the audience’s emotions. These can be positive emotions, like pride or hope, or negative ones, like fear or hatred.
    

_What is the alternative to democracy? Every man, woman, and child cowering in terror under the brutal rule of another Hitler, another Stalin! Not one home will be safe from the power of the State!_

  
  

#### Designing Arguments

The old Latin term “**dispositio**,” or “arrangement,” refers to the division of a piece of speech or writing into its components.

  
Classical rhetoric divided a composition into five parts:
- **exordium**, the introduction;
- **narratio**, the statement of the context or situation;
- **confirmatio**, the presentation of arguments and facts;
- **refutatio**, the presentation and refuting of counterarguments;
- And **peroratio**, the conclusion.

Of course, a given composition might have only some of these, and it might have them in any order, but there are some predictable patterns.

  
#### Style/Rhetorical Devices

These include **diction**, which involves precise word choice, as well as the use of different kinds of vocabulary or “register” *(e.g., poetic, technical, casual, or slang)*; and patterns of sound, like repeated consonants or vowels. Various sentence lengths and **syntax** help develop a distinct stylistic pattern, as does the design of paragraphs. Then there are **schemes**, or deviations from the ordinary arrangements of words. Two common schemes are repetition and omission. Finally, there are **tropes**, or turns/twists/play on meanings, from metaphors to puns.

  


##### Diction
What do the words we choose say about us? How do they impact the style and tone of our message? Diction can have a powerful effect on both ethos and pathos, but presents dangers as well as benefits. Ornate prose can make you sound highly educated and intelligent; it can also make you sound pretentious, or even pompous. Technical terms and jargon can establish you as someone familiar with your topic, as long as you use them correctly; they can also brand you as obscure and out of touch, and make your prose seem dry or lifeless. And elaborate metaphors and "poetic" language can sound beautiful, and move your audience; it can also be perceived as too "flowery," and actually obscure your message

##### Syntax
Depending on the length or structure of your sentences, your prose can drag laboriously or speed along; it can seem bare and simple, or complex and difficult. We won’t stop to discuss this aspect of writing at length until later; keep your eye out, though, for patterns and variations of sentence length and structure in the readings as you go through the course.

##### Schemes
_I went to the hardware store and bought a hammer, some nails, and a bottle of glue._

By contrast, the scheme of asyndeton omits the conjunction:

_Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, shrunk to this little measure?_

William Shakespeare, ["Julius Caesar,"](https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/?chapter=5&play=JC&loc=p7&_ga=2.170969193.876443730.1570213174-426526760.1564688409) 1599.

Here the omission of the conjunction causes the list to rush through in a single breath, making the list items seem to quickly pile up in a way that impresses upon us the enormity of Caesar’s loss.

  

The scheme of polysyndeton achieves the opposite effect, slowing down the list with multiple conjunctions:
_And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good._

——Genesis 1:25, 1611 King James Version

Here, the repeated conjunctions slow down the text, helping to create the solemn, sonorous intonation that we associate with the King James Version of the Bible.

##### Tropes
This is the kind of rhetorical device that you are probably most familiar with.

A trope can be as simple as a simile, which explicitly compares one thing to another: “He is as thin as a rail!” Similes will often use the words “as” or “like” to make a comparison.

If the comparison is implicit, we have a metaphor: “I've been using this truck for ten years now—it's a real workhorse!”

A more complex example of a trope is an image that is not quite possible to picture, such as Rachel Carson's description of “green twilight” in the excerpt from the 1954 speech that we considered earlier. Twilight is not more green than any other kind of light. However, by (at least partly) rendering impossible the denotative (or literal) meaning of the word, Carson emphasizes its connotative (or implied) meaning: something that is “green” is lush, full of life, and “natural.” Meanwhile, “twilight,” which most often refers to evening, carries with it a sense of impending darkness: the nearness of the end of day and, by implication, of the verdant life we can see by its light.

You may also have heard the word “trope” used to mean a comparison, situation, or concept that is overused, or a cliché. While this definition is related, we are using the term in a broader sense. It is worth remembering, however, that common tropes can be a tool in writing. But they can also dilute your message, if you have nothing original to say. Try to strike a balance between being creative and helping your audience understand new ideas by referencing the familiar
