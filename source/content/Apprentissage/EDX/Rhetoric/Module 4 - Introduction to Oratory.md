## History of oratory

The Roman teacher of rhetoric, Cicero, divided the discipline into five “canons” or parts: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. The first three are key for all kinds of compositions. The latter two, however, are only pertinent for pieces of discourse that you deliver to your audience in person

  

## Public speaking

### **Structure**

When you are writing a speech, you should bear in mind that your audience will only have one chance to understand any one thing you say. They can’t stop and replay what you just said. As a result, you will have to work to make sure that you bring them along with you. It is critical for your speech to have a clearly articulated argument that you refer back to often to keep it fresh in your hearers' minds. Your speech should also have a clear structure, with “signal phrases” that let your audience know when you are moving from one idea to the next.

  
There are several tactics that you may find useful when preparing to give an unscripted speech.

First, you will want a **clear and effective outline** of your train of thought. This will help you make sure that you cover each of your main points. It will also help you pace yourself effectively. You will want to know exactly how much time to give to each section of your speech. Make sure that there is a clock visible somewhere in the venue where you will be speaking, and that you stick to your plan. Few things are worse than nearing the end of your time and realizing you have only covered half of your points.

Secondly, **compose and memorize** two or three clear **sentences** for each section of your outline that sum up your points. A good rule is to have a suggestive or surprising opening line; a thought-provoking aside, example, or subpoint; and a firm, compelling closing statement. These will ensure that you communicate your ideas effectively and give your audience key touchstones to remember your argument with.

Third, try pairing **each point** in your speech with a vivid, effective **story or example**. Storytelling holds the attention, makes your points memorable, and helps enliven your talk.

Lastly, make sure you **get your facts straight**! If you use concrete details, memorize them carefully. Mistakes in fact or erroneous statistics will give critics plenty to talk about and will distract from your central message.

For each of these strategies, the most crucial element for success is **practice, practice, and more practice**.

### **Answering Questions**

Even if you do give a scripted speech, you will often have to answer questions or interact with your audience in some way. Don’t worry: there are ways to prepare for this, too!

**Anticipate counterarguments.** In each case, try to have a clear, emphatic, or compelling sentence memorized with which to open your response. You can then elaborate or expand on that thought or idea, but it is important to address it firmly and clearly.

**Use questions as opportunities.** There may be some additional points that you don’t have time to cover, but that you suspect your audience may be curious about; be prepared to take any relevant questions as opportunities to expand and elaborate on your argument. Again, memorize short sentences with which to open your additional points.

**Do not be afraid to reiterate.** When questions are raised that your speech already addressed, be patient with your audience. They are giving you a valuable opportunity to repeat your points. If those points matter enough to say once, they matter enough to say again and again.

**If you do not know the answer** to a question, do not be afraid to say so. Being evasive or hedging will be transparent to your audience and damage your _ethos_ tremendously.
