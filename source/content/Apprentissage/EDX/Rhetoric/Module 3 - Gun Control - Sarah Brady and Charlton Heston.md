Tips : study the argument of the opposite

## Inductive reasoning

**Indictive Reasoning** : reasoning from specific examples to form general conclusions.

Reasoning from examples also requires us to show that the examples are analogous to the case in question.

An argument based on inductive reasoning is vulnerable to challenge at all of these points. It may be said not to have relied upon a sufficiently large set of examples, it may be said to have made a false equivalency, or it may simply be contested on the grounds that it cannot ever be perfectly certain.

However, despite its limitations, inductive reasoning works. Most decisions made in life are based on probability, and most people are receptive to persuasion on the grounds of sufficient probable cause. Successful inductive arguments thus depend on the relevance and credibility of their examples. The most successful combine these with the other persuasive modes, ethical and emotional appeal.


###### Definition
The topic of definition represents a key step in making any kind of appeal to logos, and inductive reasoning is no exception. If you are attempting to use one situation as an example from which to make an inference about another situation, you will need to show that the two situations are analogous, and one key step toward doing so is to prove that specific terms mean the same thing in both cases.

*In order to argue, for example, that a free market is good for a country's prosperity, we would have to define both the term "free market" and the term "prosperity." Would a free market involve freedom for corporations from antitrust regulations? Or would it involve freedom for consumers from price manipulation by corporations? Each of these competing definitions would have an effect on how we could interpret our examples.*



###### **Similarity**

The topic of similarity is necessary for making an inductive argument because it must be shown that the examples given are analogous to each other and to the situation in question.

_In order to argue inductively that a particular country should adopt free-market policy based on examples of successful policies in other countries, we would have to show that the economic situations of those other countries were similar enough to be used as analogous cases._

###### **Difference**

The topic of difference may be useful to counter an inductive argument by showing that the examples given are not analogous to the case in question, or that the terms used in the example do not match the definition given for them in the argument itself.

_In countering the argument that a free-market policy is good for the prosperity of a country, we might seek to find differences between the example countries and the one for which the policy was being advocated, or differences between the policy proposed and the policies in the examples given._

  
  

###### **Cause and Effect**

The topic of cause and effect is likely to be necessary for making an inductive argument for a particular action based on the outcome of similar actions, because it must be shown in each example that the action was what probably caused the outcome.

_In order to argue for a particular free-market policy based on examples of positive outcomes in various countries, we would have to show that it was at least highly probable that the policy in question had caused the increases in the example countries' prosperity._

  
  

###### **Testimony**

The topic of testimony may be a useful way to present an example in an inductive argument.

_In making a case for or against free-market policies, we might quote the testimony of a defector from a communist regime, like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, or of a vocal critic of the treatment of workers in a capitalist society, like Dolores Huerta._

###### **Statistics**

Statistics is a way of presenting a very large number of cases in the aggregate, as one example.

_In making a case for or against free-market policies, we might cite GDP growth, standard of living, and other metrics for prosperity._

  
  

## Deductive reasoning

In contrast to inductive reasoning, which is the inference of general principles from particular examples, deductive reasoning applies general principles to specific cases in order to make judgments about them.

For example, if we accept the truth of the general principle that all professors teach students, and we establish that a particular person—let’s say, Dr. Arnold—is a professor, then it naturally follows that Dr. Arnold must teach students.

A construction of this sort is only as sound as the general principles it is based on. Thus, if we find that some professors are simply researchers and do not teach, we cannot say with complete certainty that Dr. Arnold teaches students.

  
  

###### **The Syllogism**

Since Aristotle, logicians have used the syllogism as a way to formulate, understand, and test bits of deductive reasoning. A syllogism is simply a way of arranging the logical parts of a deductive argument so that they can be more easily understood.

If we look back at our claim about Dr. Arnold, we can break it into the following two propositions, or premises, and a conclusion:

Premise 1. All college professors teach students.

Premise 2. Dr. Arnold is a college professor.

Conclusion. Dr. Arnold teaches students.

This allows us to see how the line of deductive reasoning works. It starts with a claim about a large number of things (professors)—and, importantly, about all of those things—and then it identifies a certain thing (Dr. Arnold) as being a part of that group. It then concludes by noting that what is true about the whole group must be true of this particular member.

We can call the general statement of a syllogism (regarding all college professors) a major premise, and the particular or specific statement (regarding Dr. Arnold) the minor premise. Most syllogisms take the following form:

All A's are B's.

All C's are A's.

Therefore, all C's are B's.

You can see, however, that other forms of syllogism are possible. For example, you may have a syllogism that involves a negative term:

No A's are B's.

C is an A.

Therefore, C is not a B.

Once we have expressed our chain of reasoning as a syllogism, we can easily check the truth of the premises—do all college professors really teach students? is Dr. Arnold really a professor?—and the validity of the logical reasoning. If all college professors really do teach students, and Dr. Arnold really is in that group, then she must indeed teach students.

The claim checks out.

  
  

###### **Validity and Truth**

It is extremely important to remember that there is a difference between valid deductive reasoning and truth. If a piece of reasoning can be expressed as a syllogism and shown to be invalid, it can very easily be refuted. Similarly, if the reasoning is valid, but one or more of the premises on which it is based can be shown to be false, the conclusion will be false.

We may say the following:

All moons are made of cheese.

Europa is a moon of the planet Jupiter.

Therefore, Europa is made of cheese.

This chain of reasoning is valid, but the conclusion is false because the major premise is false: we know that not all moons are made of cheese.

  
  

###### **The Enthymeme**

Of course, few people make their logical arguments in this painstaking, step-by-step way. Instead, they make little shortcuts to get to their claims, like making one premise or the other implicit instead of stating it outright:

  
  

_Dr. Arnold is a college professor, so she must teach students!_

In this example, the major premise—all college professors teach students—is made only by implication.

Similarly, in real life we, can rarely establish our premises with absolute certainty. As a result, we reason from probabilities:

_Most college professors teach, so Dr. Arnold probably has students._

Bits of deductive reasoning that are either abbreviated or based on claims about probability, like these two sentences, are called **enthymemes**. They help us communicate more efficiently, and they help us make judgment calls based on the evidence we have.

Sometimes, however, an enthymeme enables us to omit the least certain of the premises we reason from, concealing the weakness of our claim. As a result, whenever we hear a deductive claim, we should make sure we stop to identify its underlying assumptions. If a few professors do not teach students, and we say...:

_Dr. Arnold is a college professor, so she must teach students!_

...then we have left the premise that is based on probability unspoken, hiding the fact that our claim may not be true.

After you feel confident that you understand these elements, complete the exercise below. Finally, read the concluding section of this page, "Deductive Reasoning in Charlton Heston's Speech."

  
  

###### **Contradiction**

The example above depends on the intersection of two terms. Other syllogisms, however, might depend upon a contradiction:

_A college professor is someone who teaches students._

_Dr. Arnold does not teach students._

_Therefore, Dr. Arnold cannot be a professor._

This syllogism depends on two pairs of contradictory terms: teaching and not teaching, being a professor and not being a professor. If one term in such a pair is true, the other—by definition—must be false.

  
  

###### **Contraries**

Another topic that is similar to the topic of definition is the topic of contraries. Contraries are two terms that are opposites or that cannot both be true. In such a case, proving that one of the terms is true is enough to disprove the other. When a traffic-light is green, for example, it cannot be red: establishing that fact rules out the possibility of the other.

Sometimes, there are only two options. When we come to a fork in a road, for example, we know that our path must lie either to the left or to the right. More often, though, as in the example of the traffic-light, there are other possibilities. In this case, establishing that one of the terms is false does not prove that the other is true. If the light is not red, it may still be either green or yellow.

Often an argument that uses the topic of contraries will align two pairs of contrary terms and use one to make a claim about the other:

Daylight is the proper home of honest deeds; it is the night that harbors evil.

The two contraries here are “day” and “night,” “honest deeds” and “evil.” If a link can be established between the first two terms of the pair—“day” and “honest deeds”—we find it easy to imagine that those terms’ contraries will also coincide.

  
  

###### **Antecedent and Consequence**

Often, we will say that one thing “follows” from another: it is a result or logical conclusion. This relationship between terms is often at the heart of a deductive argument. For instance, a person discussing new infrastructure projects might say, “If we build new roads, we will have to levy new taxes to pay for them.” This can easily be the first premise of a syllogism:

If we build new roads, we will have to levy new taxes to pay for them.

We have built new roads.

Therefore, we will have to levy new taxes.

Note that, like an enthymeme, this kind of statement of antecedent and consequence generally conceals some unspoken assumption. Here, the assumption is that the only way to pay for new infrastructure projects is to levy taxes. While the syllogism is valid, we might question the truth of the initial premise by questioning that assumption. Why not build a tollbooth?

  
  

## **Think back to your first draft, and ask yourself the following questions:**

1. What other strategies can you think of for opening your piece? Can you shorten your introduction? Is there a vivid or startling anecdote with which you can begin, or some other way to command your audience's attention?

2. What kind of narratio suits your argument? Should it be short and sweet? Are there a lot of facts you need to set straight before you can make your claims?
    
3. Are the points of your argument clear and distinct? Is each backed up with evidence? Are they arranged in the best order?
    
4. What about the possible counterarguments? Have you addressed at least the most important one? Might you change where in the composition you discuss it?
    
5. Does your peroratio recap your argument? If so, does it need to? Is there something you can add here at the end: something to galvanize or inspire your audience, something to drive your message home?
	- Is there is a clear main idea/argument?
	- Is that argument presented first?
	- Is evidence provided to support that argument?
	- Have you integrated some elements of pathos?
	- Have you integrated some elements of ethos?
	- Have you used of one or more elements of rhetorical style?
	- Have you tailored your message to your audience?
