# Module 1: Introduction to Sport Nutrition Science

## 1.1 Exercice, sport and nutrition
About different types of sports, the diet of an athlete, the basics of conducting research and how to critically reflect on evidence from literature.

Physical activity = "any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle that requires energy expenditure”

Exercise is part of the broad spectrum of physical activity, but is purposeful. It has the specific purpose to improve or maintain fitness, to perform better or stay healthy.

Sport = competition aspect


Factors like strength, power, speed and endurance have a physiological and biochemical basis, which at least partly underpins performance.

### Energy metabolism
Our body has three different energy systems.

First, the so-called **phosphagen system**, which is immediately available.

Second, the short-term **anaerobic energy system**,
anaerobic means without the use of oxygen.

And third the long-term **aerobic or oxidative energy system**.

#### five types of athletes
The weightlifter, the sprinter, the middle distance athlete, the endurance athlete and the game-player.


##### weightlifter
The **weightlifter** is an example of what you could call an explosive power athlete.
Performance takes place in only one to a few seconds.
Performance for these type of athletes depends on strength
and the ability to produce force in a short time period.

1.  Muscle mass and size are important predictors of performance.
2. A nutritional strategy for this type of athletes is protein intake.  This is because protein can help the increase of muscle mass and function throughout training.

Energy metabolism is not a major issue for performance,
as enough energy is available in muscle via the immediate phosphagen system,
regarding the short duration of the exercise.


##### sprinter 
have to deliver a lot of power from a few seconds up to 20 seconds.
Muscle mass and size are also important for these athletes although too much muscle mass can limit acceleration.


As exercise duration is longer than for the explosive power sports, rapid delivery of energy to the working muscle is another crucial factor. 
The immediate phosphagen system will supply most of the energy, in particular via a compound called phosphocreatine.

Phosphocreatine is present in muscle, but can only provide energy for up to 20 seconds of exercise. With the longer sprints, so more than 20 seconds, also the anaerobic system contributes. 
The long-term aerobic system plays no, to only a limited role during sprinting.

###### nutrition
Next to protein intake to support muscle mass, increasing phosphocreatine stores in muscle via supplementation of creatine, could be a smart nutritional strategy for these athletes.


##### middle distance athlete
athlete of intense exercice of a few minute around 3 to 5 min. 
Energy is typically derived from the short-term anaerobic system. But this system will limite itself due to the accumulation of lactate and acidification. 
Diet should optimize energy store and help tolerate acidifications. 

##### Endurance athlete
Heavily relies on the long-term aerobic system. Exercice from 10 min to multiple hour.

**Note**: from a biochemical perspective, all exercise with a duration of more than 2 minutes is mainly aerobic.

Next to the biochemical qualities of the muscle tissue, the ability of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscle plays an important role in fatigue and performance.

###### Nutrition
strategy on supplying enough energy. Either by optimizing stores before exercise,
or providing energy during exercise. In particular carbohydrates.


##### Game-player
Like soccer or racket sport. 
Characteristic of these sports are : 
- the multiple sprints, with limited recovery, 
- and the long overall duration of the game.

This challenges all energy systems of the body.
The long-term aerobic system, combined with the immediate, short-term and short-term energy system to fuel the sprints.

Fatigue is linked to the depletion of energy stores, and can see that in socces when most point are made at the end, cause more mistake.

Nutrition is harder to determine precisely cause tactic or position change it, nevertheless energy, as well as protein to support muscle mass, or even phosphocreatine is relevant. 


### An athlete diet
sport nutrition pyramide : 
1. balance diet (bottom)
2. sport specific nutrition, performance and recovery
	1. timing is important
		1. the ingestion of high-quality protein is most effective immediately after your work-out. 
		2. And ingesting carbohydrates during exercise will benefit endurance exercise performance.
3. supplement
	1. back up by science are 
		1. creatine
		2. caffeine
		3. B-alanine
		4. beet-root juice

with **short term** goal as gaining or losing weight and **long term** goal of balance energy intake / need. If not, Relative Energy Deficiency in Sports, or Red-S syndrome can develop.

Athlete may need more calcium to follow the higher energy intake.


Building a proper athlete’s diet follows a step-wise approach. 
- Start with a balanced diet, covering daily energy, macronutrients and fluid needs. 
- In the next step consider sport-specific nutritional strategies, which include timing of nutrient intake to optimize performance and recovery. 
- And finally, carefully decide whether adding supplements could work for you.


## 1.2 Sport Nutritional Science
proteine supplement directly after sport and before sleeping help for muscle gains and fat lost. 

last part is about empirical experience and being critical on what you read. 


# Module 2: Skeletal Muscle, Exercise and Sports
###### After this module you will be able to:
-   Explain how muscles are built and contract during movement
-   Match different energy systems and muscle fibres types to different sports
-   Understand how muscles endure and generate power
-   Match the different muscle fiber types to different sports
-   Understand the role of the cardiorespiratory system in exercise
-   Explain how exercise physiology is put in to practice

## 2.1 Skeletal muscle anatomy
Human possess three types of muscle tissue;
1. cardiac muscle; only the heart
2. smooth muscle; fundamentally different from skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle in terms of structure, function, and contraction. It is found in the walls of hollow organs, like the gastrointestinal tract, and in the walls of passageways, such as blood vessels and the tracts of the respiratory system.
3. skeletal muscle, the one we use for sport and most movement. We have plus 600 distinc muscle. 

Before a skeletal muscle fibre can contract, it has to receive an impulse from a nerve cell. Blood vessels supply the muscle with oxygen and nutrients, and remove products, such as carbon dioxide, lactate and protons (H+).


## 2.2 Energy Metabolism
ATP is the only energy currenty of our body (for all kind of biological processes).
So body fat and blood glucose need to be transform into ATP. 

ATP release energy by splitting it Phosphate hence becoming ==ADP –Adenosine DiPhosphate==.

ADP have to be convert back to ATP to become availible again. Some energy sources can do this job very quickly and efficiently, but have a small capacity, while other sources are slow, but have a huge capacity.

#### Phosphocreatine
Phosphocreatine is, an energy-rich phosphate compound present in skeletal muscle. And can be transform in ATP really fast and without oxygen. 
But it is present in really small number in our muscle. 
Can support 20 - 30 s exercice. 


#### Glycogen 
long chain of glucose unit. 
Muscle glycogen can resynthesize ATP via two different pathways.
Via the anaerobic glycolysis, and via aerobic breakdown.

##### anaerobic glycolysis
Glycolysis is the process in which glucose is broken down into a compound called pyruvate.
=> This results in the formation of ATP.

When not enough oxygen is available, pyruvate is converted to lactate or lactate acid.
> So it is anaerobic, without the use of oxygen.


This lactate gives the ‘acid’ feeling in your legs when doing high-intensity exercise. The anaerobic glycolysis is fast, although not as fast as phosphocreatine,
and can deliver ATP at a high speed.
But : 
The acidification will slow down muscle contraction and limit performance.
This already happens after a few minutes of high-intensity exercise.


##### aerobic breakdown
Glucose and oxygen convert pyruvate to to acetyl-CoA – and not lactate.
Acetyl Co-A enters the so-called TCA-cycle – the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

The TCA cycle breaks down acetyl-CoA and releases compounds which finally, in the so-called oxidative phosphorylation, generates ATP with the means of Oxygen.

In this way, glycogen can provide 10 times more ATP than in the anaerobic pathway.


##### Fat 
fat is one of the biggest energy store in hour body, it can help us exercice for hour and even day. 
However it need a huge amount of oxygen (it is way athlete prefer energy from the blood and muscle storage).


##### CCL
All the system activate at the same time, but deliver energy at different speed.




## 2.3 Exercise Physiology and Sports
### Muscle endurance
Muscle endurance is the ability of skeletal muscle to perform sub-maximal work over a long period of time.

Muscle fibres can be roughly divided into two types: 
- type I or slow twitch fibres, 
- and type II or fast twitch fibres.

Our muscles do always have a combination of fibres types, so they are mixed.
Although the proportion differs from muscle to muscle, and between individuals!

Type I muscle fibres contract slowly and do not generate much force.
They are able to be used for a long period of time, so they are resistant to fatigue.
Type I muscle fibres do have a lot of capillaries the smallest blood vessel in the human body, to supply oxygen. And they contain a lot of mitochondria !!

Type I fibres do contain a limited amount of glycogen, but lots of fat,
so-called intramuscular triglycerides.
All these features mean that the type I muscle fibres
are very good at producing energy via the aerobic or oxidative pathway.
It will not surprise you that type I skeletal muscle fibres
are excellent for performing endurance exercise.


Type II fibres are “fast” and “white”.
Type II fibres can be divided in: 
- type IIA and
- type IIB.

Type II fibres can generate a lot of force, contract quickly, but also fatigue easily. They contain fewer blood vessels and mitochondria, but high levels of phosphocreatine and glycogen.

>better equipped for anaerobic metabolism and high power output performance.



Two key signals that regulate the number and function of mitochondria are:
1. One: the calcium release during contraction
2. and two: the decrease in energy in the muscle cell during exercise.

Both signals will finally activate a protein called PGC-1 alfa. This PGC-1 alfa is considered to be the master regulator of mitochondrial adaptations due to endurance training.

Endurance exercise training regulates the number and function of these mitochondria via PGC-1 alfa.
Elite endurance athletes have a good muscle endurance.
But more is needed to make you an elite marathon runner.


### Muscle power
Muscle power is the ability of muscles to produce force in or at a given time.

Type II muscle fiber can generate more power than Type I, due to more reactiveness (from the brain command), better ability to create energy from ATP and to receive more ATP. 
However, they are more subject to acidification - they fatigue easily. 

Exercise and nutrition are the two major regulators of protein synthesis and breakdown, and hence key factors in regulating skeletal muscle mass and function.
Contraction and amino acids both stimulate a molecule with the beautiful name 'mTOR'. mTOR is at the heart of the protein synthesis machinery. 
-> It is a signal that stimulates synthesis of new proteins.

###### Type I muscle fiber
Type I muscle fibres are very good at producing energy via the aerobic or oxidative pathway. 
It will not surprise you that type I skeletal muscle fibres are excellent for performing endurance exercise. Elite endurance athletes have a large proportion of type I fibres in their muscles. 

###### Type IIA muscle fiber
Type IIA fibres are typically for high intensity long-term anaerobic exercise as long sprints or middle-distance type of activities. 

###### Type IIB muscle fiber
Type IIB fibres are great for explosive power like short sprinters and weightlifting.


![[typeMuscleFiber.png]]





### Cardiorespiratory System
Prolonged and intense endurance training can increase your VO2max quite substantially.

**But what physiological processes drive your VO2max?**
They are the ability of your cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the contracting muscle, and the ability of your muscle to utilize oxygen, to produce ATP aerobically - so called muscle endurance.

Its assume that the respiratory system is not limited, execpt if pulmonary disease. And regular exercise training has also limited effect on your respiratory tract.

First and important aspect is your cardiac output.

Cardiac output is the amount of blood that your heart can circulate through your body per minute.
Both the maximal volume of blood your heart does pump around per beat, known as your stroke volume, as well as the maximal heart rate, determine your maximal cardiac output.
Training will increase your stroke volume and also increase a little bit your maximal heart rate.


Another aspect is the blood supply to the active skeletal muscle. During exercise, more blood is directed to your active muscles, and less to your gastro-intestinal 
tract for example. This phenomenon is called redistribution of blood.

Another aspect is the blood supply to the active skeletal muscle. During exercise, more blood is directed to your active muscles, and less to your gastro-intestinal tract for example.
> This phenomenon is called redistribution of blood.


Finally, the capacity of your blood to transport oxygen also contributes to your VO2max. Oxygen is transported via haemoglobin in your red blood cells. A low haemoglobin level content, known as anemia, due to a low iron status, will reduce your maximal aerobic capacity.
Training at high altitude will stimulate the oxygen transport capacity of the blood,
due to the relative lack of oxygen at this altitude.

# Module 3: Energy and Fluid
###### After this module you will be able to: 
- Know the components of energy expenditure
- Estimate your own MET and PAL
- Calculate the components of the pie of energy (yes there is pie in this course!)
- Estimate energy requirements for different athletes
- Mention different dietary assessment measurements
- Understand the major consequences of the RED-S Syndrome
- Explain how heat is lost and gained during exercise
- Know how to rehydrate yourself after dehydration


## 3.1 Energy Balance
### Energy Expenditure
Body 
TEE = Total daily Energy Expenditure.
Made of : 
1. Basal Metabolic Rate => for heart, lung and many bodil functions.
	-most of our energy goes there
	- express on kilocal / min 
	- depend on body size and particulary lean mass (fat free mass), age and gender too
	- can use equation to estimate
2. Thermal effect of food or Diet Induced Thermogenesis (DIT) 
	- general approximately 10% of total energy expenditure
	- It is the energy expended for the digestion, absorption, transport and storage of nutrients.
	- depend on the size of the meal
		- proteine is the most "expensive" for DIT (aka, need more energy)
		- fat the lowest and carbohydrate are intermediate.
3. Energy cost of physical activity (PAEE)
	- divided in exercise activity thermogenesis (energy for everything we do)
		- the energy cost of sports-like activities on one hand
		- and non-exercise activity thermogenesis on the other hand,

#### Tool to compute PAEE
##### MET
MET stands for metabolic equivalent.
A MET score indicates how many times the basal metabolic rate is - or should be - increased to perform a certain type of activity.
This implies that a MET of 1 is resting energy expenditure. A MET of 1 is roughly equivalent to 1 kcal per kg body weight per hour. Standing for example has a MET score of ~1.3; so it requires 30% more energy than being completely at rest.
While running has a MET score of at least 8.
Assuming that you are 60 kg and run for 1 hour you will burn 8 times 60 times 1 hour = 480 kcals.

##### PAL 
PAL stands for Physical activity Level.
to quantify or characterize a person’s daily level of physical activity a PAL score can be calculated.
PAL is your total daily energy expenditure divided by your basal metabolic rate
– a similar approach as for MET scores, but now for a day – and not for a single activity.
So, a PAL of 2 means that the total daily energy expenditure of someone
is twice his or her basal metabolic rate.

On average total daily energy expenditure is approximately 1.4 times basal metabolic rate.

Energy availability below 30 kcal per kg of fat free mass (FFM) is too low; 45 FFM is a good approxmation. 





## 3.2 Fluid
### 3.2.1 Heat Balance
Humans are homeotherms, which means that we maintain a stable internal body temperature. When doing exercise, this stability is challenged.

Body core below 35 degree = hypothermia and above 38 degree = hyperthermia.

The human heat balance can be written as follows:
> Metabolism = +/- Radiation +/- Conduction +/- Convection + Evaporation +/- Storage 

We as humans are the best animals ‘designed’ to cope with the heat!
We have sweat, that can cool us down really fast. 

==Storage== is the final part of the heat balance. It is actually not a real heat loss pathway. However the body has the option to store some heat, and thereby allowing the body core temperature to increase. This makes the need to lose all the produced heat via heat loss pathways slightly lower. During exercise body core temperature can easily go up to 39, even 40°C – so, fever like – without harm, but eventually it will decrease performance. When heat loss is greater than heat production, body core T goes down of course – a kind of negative heat storage.

Radiation, conduction and convection are called ‘dry heat loss’, while evaporation (both respiratory and via sweat) is ‘wet heat loss’

Wet heat loss is the dominant mechanism when dealing with the heat, as it is still effective if environmental temperature is above body temperature. Dry heat loss prevails in colder conditions and can result in hypothermia if no appropriate behavioural actions are taken.

### 3.2.2 Dehydration

At the end of this video, you will know how to assess hydration status
and sweat rate, and what the consequences of dehydration are.

When you are well hydrated, this state is called **euhydration**.
A more-than-normal fluid state is called **hyperhydration**.
A Body water deficit of more than 2% of your body weight is defined as
**hypohydration or dehydration** – so a lower-than-normal fluid state.

Hydration status can be measured, by assessing for example the ‘concentration’,
or more precisely: the osmolarity or specific gravity - of your blood or urine.

>  Pale urine –straw like - reflects normal hydration or hyperhydration,
while a dark yellow or orange, amber colour is indicative of dehydration.
In this case the urine is very concentrated as the body tries to retain as much fluid as possible.

Can lose lot of fluid by respiration (and sweat), respiration especialy when it is cold, in mountain or dry condition. 

Sweat rates can vary from close to zero to more than 2 litres per hour.

> to calculate sweat rate, weight before and after, 1g lost = 1mm of sweat.

Dehydration of 1 to 2 % can affect performance.
Dehydration  – often in combination with hyperthermia – can result in symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, confusion and in extreme cases even shock and death.

Endurance exercice are the most at risk of dehydration. 

### 3.2.3 Rehydration
Sport drinks can generally be divided into two categories.
- **Energy drinks** with plenty of carbohydrates, which you should take when energy provision is your main concern
- and **thirst quenchers**, which contain little sugar, but some electrolytes.
These are your first choice when rehydration is your main concern.

Rehydration drinks contain some carbohydrates 4 to 5 % in general.
So 40 to 50 gram per litre. This is not only a source of energy but also assist in the absorption of water across the intestine.
Water is ‘dragged along’ passively when carbohydrates are taken up.
But too many carbohydrates – as in an energy drink – will delay fluid absorption

#### Electrolyse
#### Sodium
So, sodium in the drink will replace the sodium that is lost via sweating.
This is however not the most important aspect of sodium in your drink. Sodium will facilitate absorption of water but also helps to retain the fluid you ingest and to keep the sensation of thirst intact.

#### How much to drink
In general, thirst is a somewhat delayed signal. So, during exercise, start early in particular when you know that fluid loss will be high.
Drink small amounts at regular intervals to prevent a body weight loss of more than 1-2% which is known to impact exercise performance.

Cold drinks could have some advantage from a thermoregulatory perspective, but cold beverages can also slow down gastric emptying a bit or even cause complaints.

After exercise, drinking an amount that equals your fluid loss will not results in complete rehydration even with an optimal sodium content – as drinking will always result in some urine output.

> That is why it is recommended to drink 150% of your fluid loss.

Exactly how much you should drink is highly variable and depends on your sweat rate.

So you should know your own sweat rate ! 

To summarize, stay hydrated !

Use a drink containing electrolytes, in particular sodium, and some carbohydrates.
Drink during exercise to prevent a body weight loss of more than 1-2%.
Small portions at frequent time intervals. Start to rehydrate as soon as possible after exercise in particular when a next exercise session will follow soon an amount covering 150% of your losses will do the job.


### Note on drinking
Before exercice: 
strat drinking few hour before workout

During exercice: 
Consumption of beverages containing electrolytes and carbohydrates can help sustain fluid-electrolyte balance and exercise performance.

Before, during and after, you can still take snack with sodium. 

Individuals needing rapid and complete recovery from excessive dehydration can drink ̴1.5 L of fluid for each kilogram of body weight lost.

# Module 4: Macronutrients
###### After this module you will be able to:
-   Explain the differences between carbohydrates and fat as fuel and what determines their use during exercise
-   Formulate nutritional advice about carbohydrate ingestion and performance and explain this
-   Mention and explain which strategies can improve fat oxidation
-   Understand how protein is synthesized and broken down in the muscle
-   Formulate nutritional advice about protein ingestion and performance and explain this
-   Elaborate on which type of athlete can benefit from which energy source


## 4.1 Carbohydrates and Fat
### 4.1.2 Introduction to Macronutrients
#### Fat
Fat provides the energy and building blocks for cells and protects your body. Fat (tissue) also insulates the body. Dietary fat consists of triglycerides, sterols, and phospholipids. Our daily fat intake consists mainly of triglycerides. They are composed of glycerol with three fatty acids attached.

There are three types of fatty acids, which differ in chemical structure: 

-   saturated
-   monounsaturated
-   polyunsaturated fatty acids

The unsaturated fatty acids are considered healthy fats. 

After consumption, dietary fat is broken down into fatty acids and glycerol which is absorbed by the intestine. These are transported through your body via so-called ‘chylomicrons’ to organs, such as muscles to be used as fuel, or stored in adipose tissue. When needed, for example during exercise, fats are mobilized from these stores to be used by the working muscles and other organs.

#### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are used by the body as an energy source and building blocks. Carbohydrates can be divided in digestible and non-digestible carbohydrates. Fibres are non-digestible carbohydrates and cannot be absorbed by the body, but have an important role in health. They, amongst others, contribute to the digestion process. 

Carbohydrates consist of saccharides (sugars) and can be classified according to their number:

-   Monosaccharides (1 saccharide), 
-   Disaccharides (2 saccharides)
-   Oligosaccharides (3-9 saccharides) 
-   Polysaccharides (>9 saccharides)

Glucose and fructose are examples of monosaccharides and sucrose (‘table sugar’) of a disaccharide. Starch and also glycogen are examples of polysaccharides. 

Carbohydrates are broken down to monosaccharides in the mouth and intestine. After this, they (mainly glucose) are absorbed to be used by tissues. Glucose can be stored in the muscle and liver as glycogen.

#### Protein

Proteins are important for growth, maintenance and protection of the body. They are the building blocks of the body and have roles as enzymes, hormones and transporters.

Protein consists of long chains of amino acids. There are two types of amino acids: 
-   non-essential acids 
-   essential amino acids 

The body cannot synthesize essential amino acids, that is why these are essential. They should be obtained by the diet. There are 20 amino acids, of which 9 are essential. Proteins can be divided in animal and plant-based proteins. The quality of protein sources differs. This depends on the essential amino acid content and how well the protein can be digested. 

Proteins are digested in the stomach and in the intestine. In the stomach they are broken down into polypeptides (linked amino acids) and in the intestine into smaller peptides and eventually individual amino acids. They enter the bloodstream and travel to organs and tissues, serving as building blocks for the synthesis of body proteins. 


### 4.1.3 Carbohydrates and Fat as Energy Source
Glucose is a ‘versatile’ fuel as it can be used both in the anaerobic as well as the aerobic system.
In skeletal muscle, glucose is either derived from the blood or from stored glycogen.


Fat, or more precise **fatty acids**, are derived from lipid stores in adipose tissue
and transported to the muscle via the blood, or are derived from small lipid stores in the muscle itself: ==intramuscular lipids.==

> In contrast to glucose, fat can only be used in the aerobic system to produce energy.

Fat, being the slightly less efficient energy source, is mostly used at lower intensity aerobic exercise.

Final distinction, carbohydrate is limited in storage, unlike fat. 


During prolonged exercise, in particular when you are not eating, the body mainly relies on fat as an energy source.
Any improvement to utilize fat during exercise as an energy source will preserve the limited carbohydrates stores.

> So, intensity and duration are two important aspects of exercise in determining which fuel, carbohydrates or fat, is oxidised.


So, intensity and duration are two important aspects of exercise in determining which fuel, carbohydrates or fat, is oxidised.
And of course, it isn’t simply one or the other.
It is mostly a mixture – but the mixture differs as the intensity changes or the exercise continues for a longer time.


To optimize endurance exercise performance, athletes will try to improve fat oxidation via training - sometimes with dietary manipulation; and to optimize carbohydrate availability when competing.

### 4.1.4 Glycogen
Did you ever hit the wall?
I mean that moment of sudden fatigue and loss of energy during endurance exercise?
It is also called the bonk, or in Dutch: ‘hongerklop’. It is caused by the depletion of your glycogen stores in liver and skeletal muscle.

Glycogen is how our body stores carbohydrates.
It is a large molecule containing long chains of glucose molecules.
It is mainly found in skeletal muscle and liver.


On a high carbohydrate diet, muscle glycogen stores are much higher than on low carbohydrate diet.
And that is why athletes, in particular those active in endurance exercise, increase their carbohydrate intake the days before a competition.
Because starting the race with high glycogen levels will delay the point of fatigue.

To optimize your glycogen stores, it is advised to ingest at least 7 to 10 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram body weight per day. And in case of more extreme endurance exercise maybe even up to 10 to 12 gram. 
That is quite a lot!

For quick recovery of your glycogen after exercise it is advised to consume 1 gram of carbohydrates per kilogram body weight, during the 1st hour.

Complete recovery of your glycogen levels takes 20 to 24 hours but can be accelerated a bit when you apply a rather ‘aggressive’ carbohydrate intake strategy: 
Eating immediately after exercise and having multiple meals with lots of carbohydrates, before going to sleep.

### 4.1.5 Carbohydrates to Support Performance
Body seems to have a kind of ceiling for the oxidation of ingested glucose during exercise.
This is around 1 gram of glucose per minute, or 60 gram per hour.

Absorption of glucose, so transport across the wall of your intestine is limiting.
The capacity of the glucose transporters in your gut limits glucose absorption to 1 gram per minute.

An optimal strategy is to ingest 90 gram of carbohydrates per hour with a 2 to 1 ratio for glucose and fructose.
So 60 gram glucose and 30 gram fructose.
Cause fructose use another makes use of another transporter in the gut.

> Multiple small ingestions will work best, instead of a large amount once per hour.

Many polysaccharides, which are long chains of monosaccharide units, are absorbed as quickly as monosaccharides. **Starches** are an example of polysaccharides. Maltodextrin is a well-known polysaccharide in sports.

> fibres should not be part of your foods eaten during exercise,
notwithstanding their health benefits.

Cause they slow digestion. 


###### Recommandation
When you know that the exercise will be long and hard, start immediately, and try to ingest up to 90 gram per hour, with a 2 to 1 ratio of glucose and fructose.
This definitely requires some gastro-intestinal training;

When exercise is shorter, so below 90 minutes, carbohydrates ingestion is of lesser concern, as your endogenous stores are large enough.
But some carbohydrate ingestion can still improve performance.
With short-term performance, so roughly up to 45 minutes, maybe you can do some mouth rinsing.

### 4.1.7 Strategies to Improve Fat Oxidation

Regular training improves the capacity of your muscles to oxidize fat. After a period of training, your body will rely more on fat oxidation at the same workload,

Improving the capacity of your body to oxidize fat during exercise is an important strategy for endurance athletes.


## 4.2 Protein
### 4.2.1 Muscle Protein Synthesis and Breakdown
It is estimated that within a period of roughly 3 months a muscle is completely renewed, as by that time all the muscle proteins are replaced by new ones.

Proteins are long chains of amino acids, and during synthesis these are placed in the right order to create a functional protein.

Skeletal muscle protein breakdown is more or less the reverse process.
Muscle proteins are broken down into amino acids. And these amino acids can be re-utilized to create new proteins, but some will also be oxidized and provide energy.
Exercise and nutrition are the two key regulators of muscle protein synthesis and breakdown.

During exercice, protein breakdown is activate. After exercise the process of protein synthesis is stimulated, also via mTOR, while protein breakdown will return to normal levels.
However supply of amino acids is needed to really synthesize muscle protein.
Ingesting a meal, or more precise protein, quickly after exercise will result in a higher protein synthesis and larger fed gains than with a meal only.

### 4.2.2 Protein to Support Performance
For healthy adults it is estimated that the average requirement, so the average need, is 0.66 gram protein per kilogram body weight.

Based on this, the RDA – the recommended intake is set at 0.80 grams protein per kilogram body weight per day. (higher so sure that everyone meet their need).
Recommendations for athletes range from 1.2 to 2.0 gram per kilogram body weight.

> After exercice, eat 15 to 25 g of high quality protein within the first 2 hour after exercice

> The advice is to ingest another 20 gram protein every 4 to 6 hours after exercise.

A protein which contains all essential amino acids in sufficient amounts is a so-called complete or high quality protein.
Soy, egg, and the milk proteins whey and casein are high quality proteins.

During sleep, which is a long period of fasting, protein balance can be improved when ingesting around 20 gram of protein just before bed-time.


### 4.2.3 Protein Intake Recommendations

#### Post-exercise protein recommendations
15-25 grams of high quality protein in the early recovery phase (0-2 h after exercise)
MPS is maximised when providing ~10 g essential amino acids in the early recovery phase, which translates to a high quality protein intake of 0.25– 0.30 g/kg body weight or 15–25 g protein across the typical range of athlete body weights.

#### Key message
Skeletal muscle adaptation to training can be maximized by ingesting high quality protein at a level of 0.3 g/kg BW after key exercise sessions (15-25 gram), and a same amount every 3–5 hours over multiple meals. This translates to an overall daily intake of 1.2-2.0 g /kg BW per day.

## 5.1 Introduction to Micronutrients and Sports

### 5.1.3 Function of Micronutrients in Sports
Iron, calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, the B vitamins are of extra interest to athletes.

Minerals are needed for structures in the body, like bones and teeth. They are essential to maintain normal body function like heart rhythm, muscle contraction and oxygen transport.

Vitamins are also needed for normal health and body function. They are, for example, needed to catalyze chemical processes or for energy metabolism.

Both, minerals and vitamins, should be obtained via diet.

Iron is needed for oxygen transport. Without enough iron, an athlete will feel tired and weak.
Calcium and magnesium; they are needed for muscle contraction and relaxation.
Every movement you make involves calcium and magnesium. Without enough calcium and magnesium, your muscles will feel weak and your performance goes down.

Calcium, together with vitamin D is also needed for healthy bones. Healthy bones are less prone to stress fractures.

### 5.1.4 Micronutrients Intake & Sports
The amount of micronutrients, like magnesium, iron, zinc, sodium potassium, vitamin C and B that are lost by sweating vary a lot per individual. It is not a large problem, but athletes have to be aware of this.


## 5.2 Micronutrients in Sports

### 5.2.1 Iron
Iron is a crucial component of the proteins haemoglobin and myoglobin.

The main nutritional sources for iron are meat, cereals and beans.

We often divide iron in heme and non-heme iron. Heme iron is the type of iron found in animal products in our diet. Non-heme iron, by contrast, is found in plant-based foods, like grains, beans, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds.
The uptake of heme iron is better compared to non-heme iron.

Iron is transported through the body with the help of a protein called transferrin. Another protein, called ferritin, helps with the storage of iron. Iron can be stored in the liver and some cells. 
Iron stores can be large, so even when your diet is poor, it takes a while before stores are really depleted.

The recommended daily allowance for iron is 18 mg/d for women and 8 mg/d for men.

Some athletes run a lot, which causes a repeated and forceful impact of the feet with the ground. This breaks red blood cells and as a result, iron is lost. This is called foot-strike haemolysis.

Too much iron is toxic !!

### 5.2.2 Magnesium 
Green leafy vegetables are high in magnesium

People with magnesium shortages experience muscle cramps, muscle weakness and neuromuscular problems
But I have to say: a real magnesium deficiency is not that common in athletes. If you eat a healthy regular diet rich in green leafy vegetables, seeds, nuts and fish, your magnesium levels are probably good.

Magnesium uptake in the intestine is more efficient when dietary magnesium intake is low or when magnesium status is poor.
In addition, magnesium excretion via urine is lower when magnesium status is poor and higher when magnesium status is good.
In this way, our body maintains a healthy magnesium level. Extra magnesium can be stored in bones and other body tissues.

A healthy magnesium intake is around 420 mg per day for men and around 320 mg per day for women. A normal blood magnesium concentration is between 0.70 and 1 mmol/L.

Magnesium is of major importance for glucose metabolism, as it is an important regulator of many enzymes involved in glycolysis.


### 5.2.3 Vitamin D and Calcium
When sunlight touches the skin, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to previtamin D3 this is converted to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D which is converted to 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which is called calcitriol and this is the biologically active form of vitamin D.

Vitamin D via diet, is converted to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D as well and then follows the same pathway to become calcitriol.

Vitamine D is needed for optimal bone health and normal muscle function. Vitamin D is involved in the uptake of calcium and calcium is needed for healthy bones. Vitamin D is also very important for immune function and protein synthesis.

Athletes might need more vitamin D, because they need more calcium.

### 5.2.4 Vitamin B
There are 8 B vitamins.
Here I will cover the ones directly affecting exercise performance, namely thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, folic acid and vitamin B12. The first three, thiamin, riboflavin, and vitamin B-6 are needed for energy production in our body.
The other two, folic acid and vitamin B-12, are needed for the synthesis of new cells, such as red blood cells and for the repair of damaged cells.

Regular exercise training may increase the need for B vitamins. The metabolic pathways that produce energy are more stressed during exercise, and therefore, more vitamin B might be needed.

In addition, exercise might increase the loss of vitamins in sweat, urine or faeces. And finally, more vitamin B might be needed to repair and maintain the higher lean tissue mass of athletes.

Athletes who restrict their dietary energy intake for weight loss or those who eliminate selected food groups, such as dairy or meat are more at risk for a vitamin B deficiency. Athletes who do have a vitamin B deficiency mainly have problems with exercise at high intensity.

## 5.3 Ergogenic Supplements
### 5.3.1 Introduction to Ergogenic Supplements
Ergogenic stems from the Greek word ‘Ergon’, which means ‘work’. Ergogenic supplements are ‘work enhancing’ supplements. In sports and exercise this means that they can improve physical performance.


Athletes can have many reasons to use supplements. Three frequently heard reasons are:
1. to treat or prevent nutrient deficiencies;
2. for convenient provision of energy and nutrients around an exercise session (‘sports foods’), and
3. to achieve a specific and direct performance benefit in competition (=ergogenic).

In this sub-module we will critically look at the latter use of supplements: the performance-enhancing or ergogenic supplements. Correcting or preventing (micro)nutrient deficiencies was the topic of the first part of this module, while ‘sports foods’ (rehydration drinks, energy bars/gels and protein supplements) were the topics of module 4 on macronutrients. We will focus on ‘informed decision making’. What do you need to know before making the decision to use 
an ergogenic supplement. 

### 5.3.3 Ergogenic Supplements Part II
**Caffeine**|..
--|--
Overview| Caffeine is a stimulant that possesses well-established benefits for athletic performance across endurance-based situations, and short-term, supramaximal and/or repeated sprint tasks.
Mechanism|Adenosine receptor antagonism; increased release brain hormone endorphin; improved neuromuscular function; improved vigilance and alertness; reduced perception of exertion during exercise.
Protocol of use|3–6 mg/kg of body weight, in the form of anhydrous caffeine (i.e. pill or powder form), consumed ~60 min prior to exercise.
Performance Impact|Improved endurance capacity such as exercise time to fatigue and endurance-based time-trial (TT) activities of varying duration (5–150 min), across numerous exercise modalities (i.e. cycling, running, rowing and others).
Further considerations and potential side effects|Larger caffeine doses (≥9 mg/kg BM) do not appear to increase the performance benefit, and are more likely to increase the risk of negative side-effects, including nausea, anxiety, insomnia and restlessness.

Caffeine is a diuretic promoting increased urine flow, but this effect is small at the doses that have been shown to enhance performance.

## 5.4. Antioxidants
Antioxidants are substances that can prevent or slow down damage to cells caused by so-called free radicals. Free radicals are atoms, molecules or ions that are highly reactive.

Free radicals are produced by the body during many processes. Free radicals are needed in the body, for example for cell signalling processes and for supporting the immune system.
However these free radicals can also be harmful, because they can damage cells and DNA.

An example of a free radical, is the so called reactive oxygen species, or ROS in short, and they are produced in mitochondria.
During exercise, the production rate of ROS will increase. It is important that this happens because it is needed for training adaptation.

In the past, athlete where advise to increase antioxidant to counter ROS increase. Now it's not advice anymore.

Athletes need a healthy level of antioxidants. But where can we find them? First of all, antioxidants are produced by the body. Antioxidants are also found in your diet. The best known dietary antioxidants are vitamin E, vitamin C, and Beta-carotene. The body cannot manufacture these last micronutrients.

Dietary sources high in antioxidants are: fruits and vegetables, grain products and nuts and seeds.
So, to conclude. The current guidelines for athletes will tell you that regular consumption of antioxidant supplements is not needed, but just to eat healthy, with enough fruit and vegetables, so your antioxidant intake will be sufficient.



# Module 6: Exercise, Nutrition and Healthy Ageing
###### These are the learning goals:
- Understand how and why physical performance and muscle mass decreases during ageing
- Explain why hospitalization and immobilization have a large impact on muscle mass loss
- Understand the concept of muscle quality
- Recall that older adults very often have a low protein intake
- Know why older adults need more protein than young people
- Identify which determinants underlie the low protein intake
- Understand the term anabolic resistance, and what it means in daily practice
- Explain the concept Better in, Better out

### 6.2 Protein & Exercise
### 6.2.1 Main Issues During Ageing and Patients
While aging, three changes, that are all related to skeletal muscle tissue:
- First, loss of muscle mass.
- Second, the loss of muscle strength.
- And finally, the loss in muscle quality

Loss of muscle mass and strength is known as **sarcopenia**. As you can see, when we age normally, we gradually lose mass and strength after the age of 30, with around 3-8 % every 10 years.

Occasions such as hospitalization, or immobilization accelerate sarcopenia.

 Muscle strength decreases faster than muscle mass, with around 30% per decade.

Fat infiltration is one way muscle quality may decrease. Other ways are: 
- Type I and type II have specifi loss of muscle fiber. 
- Loss in mitochondrial functioning.

During ageing, we observe both a loss in the number of mitochondria
and a loss in the function of mitochondria.


### 6.2.2 Caveats Regarding Protein & Exercise
Resistance exercise and increased protein intake to improve muscle mass and muscle strength.

Older people need to eat more proteine. And proteine at each meal, 20 to 35g of protein minimum. 

2 muscle strenghening exercice for at least 2 days every days is the minimum for eldery people.

### 6.2.3 Increased Protein Requirements
There are multiple factors in older adults that hamper the anabolic response to protein intake. To overcome these issues, older adults need a protein dose that is almost double to that of young individuals to maximally stimulate muscle growth.

Note older adulte should use protein shake. 


## 6.3 Effective Strategies
### 6.3.1 Guideline
![[nutrimentOlderPeople.png]]
The guidelines for physical activity for adults aged 65 years and older, as formulated by the World Health Organisation are: 

1. Older adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. 

2. Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration. 

3. For additional health benefits, older adults should increase their moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or engage in 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate-and vigorous-intensity activity. 

4. Older adults, with poor mobility, should perform physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.

5. Muscle-strengthening activities, involving major muscle groups, should be done on 2 or more days a week.

6. When older adults cannot do the recommended amounts of physical activity due to health conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow.

### 6.3.2 Better In Better Out
During hospital stays, older adults lose around 600 grams of muscle mass per week. The reasons for this loss are manifold.
- First, many older adults are already in a state of muscle mass reduction before they enter the hospital.
- Second, older adults show large hormonal changes during hospitalization. For instance, they have high levels of cortisol, the hormone that is increased during stress and brings the body into a catabolic state thereby losing muscle mass.
- And third, older adults show a higher rate of inflammation, which also leads to reduced muscle mass.

To regain 600 grams of muscle mass that is lost in 1 week of hospitalization, the patient has to follow intense resistance exercise and nutrition programs for more than 3 months.

A way to prevent the net muscle mass loss during hospitalization, is by improving muscle mass before the hospitalization.
We call these approaches prehabilitation or, more simply put,: better in better out.

Within these approaches, surgery is addressed as if it was a sport competition we want to train for.
Often, there is a window of a few weeks to “train” the patient. In these weeks patients are assigned a training schedule that usually consists of resistance exercise, aerobic exercise and nutritional support, to optimize a patient’s health before surgery.
Of course, these programs are tailored to the individual, depending on their capabilities and the reason of their planned surgery.
