==What food and nutriment to eat to improve well being==


#### Module 1
Objective : 
-   Be familiar with the course setup, your time commitment, and the course team
-   Understand the current situation in mental health care
-   Recognise the solutions available through good nutrition
-   Discover the brain’s nutritional needs


Question for food diary : 
-   What were some key emotions you felt?
-   How were your energy levels?
-   Did you have any highs or lows?
-   How did you manage your stress levels?

[Recent research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942748) has shown that food supplements such as zinc, magnesium, omega 3, and vitamins B and D3 can help improve people’s mood, relieve anxiety and depression and improve the mental capacity of people with Alzheimer’s.

inflammatory response starts in our gut and is associated with a lack of nutrients from our food such as magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, vitamins and minerals

eating probiotics daily.

A processed food is simply one that’s been altered from its original form, while ultra-processed has things added, such as food dyes, added sugars or chemical preservatives. Heating, pasteurizing, canning, fermenting and drying are all considered forms of processing. Frozen vegetables are an example of a processed food. The technique of freezing fresh produce is considered “processing”; however, in this case it doesn’t mean it’s “unhealthy” - the original fresh produce hasn’t had anything added, it’s just been frozen in its original form to increase longevity.

note : statistical correlation between starvation during pregnancy and developement of schizophrenia for the child. 

consuming a diet that is rich in fresh foods can boost our mental wellbeing.

effects of starvation mirror mental health problems, including:

-   increased emotional distress, depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis (focus on bodily changes)
-   increased irritability
-   feeling apathetic and lethargic
-   social withdrawal and isolating
-   reduced concentration, comprehension and decision-making abilities

When we skip a meal or go a long time between meals we can experience a mild form of these symptoms, or what you might call being ‘hangry’. If you have experienced this sensation, imagine what the effects could be of an ongoing lack of food and feelings of hunger.

###### Rapid change in diet over last century
Food pyramids focus on the macro level. Macro means large, and in the context of food this typically means carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Often think in calory.  

one issus in calory counting is that all calory are not equal. 

Researchers found that worldwide we are consuming too much processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and salt, while we are not consuming enough whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts or seeds.


#### Module  2: Introduction to nutrients relevant to brain health.
In Module 1, you learnt about macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and fats), calories and food labels.

In Module 2, you will learn about micronutrients: including what they are and their importance in your diet.

After completing this module you will be able to:

-   Understand the more detailed nutritional make up of foods and refocus on the micro-levels nutrition
-   Recognise the brain’s basic needs and how to feed it
-   Identify the range of ways in which micronutrients maintain and support the body
-   Identify micronutrient rich foods

essential fatty acids and their important role in brain development and functioning
balance of omega-3 fatty acids to omega-6 fatty acids.
The balance in our diets should be 1:1, or perhaps 2:1, of omega-6 to omega-3.

Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, not water-soluble, which means they get stored in the body's fatty tissue.
Over consuming them can become harmfull. 
The other are water soluble, if eat more than need, rest is excrete. 

The first reading provides a comprehensive glossary of macro- and micro- nutrients:
-   Morris, A.L., Mohiuddin, S.S. (2020). [Biochemistry, Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554545/). In: _StatPearls_ [Internet]. May18, 2020.

This next article gives an overview of the benefits of different micronutrients for the human body:
-  Huskisson, E., Maggini, S., Ruf, M. (2007). [The role of vitamins and minerals in energy metabolism and well-being](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/147323000703500301). _Journal of International Medical Research,_ Volume 35, Issue 3, Pages 277-89.

micronutrients are important for neurotransmitter and vital to help the energy organelles of your cells, the mitochondria, to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, produces ATP and is completely dependent on micronutrients to function.

![[krebsDiagram.png]]

when we eat, we primarly feed the brain.

Fernstrom, J.D. (2016). [A Perspective on the Safety of Supplemental Tryptophan Based on Its Metabolic Fates](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/146/12/2601S/4589965). _The Journal of Nutrition_. Volume 146, Issue 12, Pages 2601S–2608S.



we need to consume a broad range of micronutrients for optimal brain functioning. Because to produce one neurotransmitter we need many distinc micronutrients.

nutrition affect gene expression (_epigenetics_). Honey bee feed a queen, she have the same genetic as the other bee.
Scientists have uncovered that genes themselves, are controlled in a way similar to how a dimmer switch may control the ceiling lights in your home. We refer to that variability as genetic regulation.
This have to do with methyl group. Methyl have are part of the reconstruction of the DNA and it readability. 


In the next section we will explore the impact that environmental toxins can have on mental health and how important micronutrients are to help our bodies eliminate these toxins.

environmental pollutants have a big impact on health and mental health. example of BPA (bisphenol A).
Evidence of a relationship between prenatal exposure to BPA and increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems in children, such as poorer motor skills, and problems with attention, hyperactivity, and social communication.

Three sorts of toxins - 
1. the chemicals that might be naturally in food like some of the natural toxins that are present in plants to ward off pests like insects and perhaps fungi. 
2. There's things that we might add to food at the end to preserve it and we'll talk about some of those perhaps a little bit later on, 
3. and there are chemicals that might be acquired from the environment like pesticides and environmental pollutants and that can find their way into plants and animals that are grazing on plants and therefore into our food.

Some micro plastic may affect the brain in the uteruse. Because they look a bit like the female hormone 17 beta- estradiol. And they can bind into the hormone receptor in as a lock and key way and they can switch on feminizing aspects of the cell. Hense, impacting the brain development in the uterus. 

There is many other toxin that impact brain development and most of them have negative impact such as lowering IQ. 
If take individually, it is tiny tiny but they all add there biochemical impact and it become less tiny. + cocktail effect. 

Micronutrients  that we get out of our food are required in order to assist with detoxification.
A diet rich in antioxidants and other anti-inflammatory nutrients help with the de-toxination process / eliminate toxins. 

Antidressant nutriment : 1.  vitamins such as folate, thiamine, vitamin A, B6, B12 and vitamin C, minerals, such as iron, magnesium, potassium, selenium, and zinc, and omega-3.
Top brain food did they score for nutritionally-rich anti-depression?
- In animal foods, the highest scores were for bivalves, such as oysters and mussels, other types of seafood, and organ meats. 
- And for plant foods, the highest scores were for leafy greens, lettuces, peppers,  and cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, kale, and cauliflower. 
Not coincidentally, all of these foods are an integral part of the [Mediterranean diet].

#### Module 3 : Dietary patterns and mental health.
In this module, I will introduce you to:
-   the research on diet and mental health,
-   how researchers assess dietary patterns, and
-   the different ways they can understand relationships between what you eat and how you feel.

Diet + mental health+ sport -> c'est bien. 

prospective studies, show that poor diet seems to precede poor mental health. 

diet is primoridal during maternity. 


The top 10 raw foods related to better mental health were: lettuce, apples, berries, bananas, citrus fruits like grapefruit and oranges, kiwi fruit, carrots, leafy vegetables like spinach, and cucumber.
Brookie KL, Best GI, Conner TS. (2018)  "[Intake of Raw Fruits and Vegetables Is Associated With Better Mental Health Than Intake of Processed Fruits and Vegetables](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5902672/)". Front Psychol. 2018;9:487

see SMILES Trial for impact of those food. 
Note: keep an eye on keto diet. 


#### Module 4 : The factors that influence the supply of nutrients to the brain.
-   Discuss the individual factors that can compromise the ability of food alone to support our mental health
-   Recognize the wide range of environmental factors that can cause nutrient depletion in our food supply
-   Describe ways to support the health of your microbiome (healthy gut)

Lack of nutrients available for the brain can affect its functioning, including its ability to effectively make neurotransmitters. In turn, reducing the supply of neurotransmitters could impact our emotional states.

Growing a baby in the womb increases the need for nutrients. It is important that during pregnancy we ensure that we are consuming enough vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids for the health of the mother and the developing baby.

As our bodies age, we are no longer as effective at absorbing, metabolising and using the nutrients in our die. Part of the problem is our ability to absorb and process nutrients which decreases with age, especially as digestive acid decreases. Nutrients like folic acid, vitamin b12, calcium, iron, beta-carotene, may no longer be absorbed as well as they once were.

Stress increase our need for nutriment. The triage theory try to explain it. 

Taking medications long-term can increase our need for specific nutrients. There are times in life where we may need to take certain medications for a long-time; during these periods it may be important to ensure we are giving our body the full array of nutrients it needs.


Medication use can interfere with nutrient status. Aspirin can negatively affect Vitamin C levels. Contraceptives can decrease folate, magnesium, and vitamins B6, C and E. Metformin can reduce vitamin B12.
Mood stabilisers can reduce folic acid, vitamin D, B6 and B12 levels, as well as minerals such as copper, selenium and zinc. Proton pump inhibitors reduce absorption of micronutrients into the intestinal cells such as B12, calcium, zinc and magnesium.
And finally, statins. Statins can inhibit the function of CoQ10, an essential player in the citric acid cycle, which is so important for the production of our energy molecule, ATP.
Simply taking more nutriment reverse the issus.

When our gut microbes are healthy and balanced, they can help support our health and mental wellbeing. However, when they are unbalanced, we can experience physical symptoms, including reflux, pain, diarrhea and/or constipation.
what goes on in the gut, influences our mood and thoughts and vice versa.


A prebiotic is a non-digestible type of plant-based fibre that's good for the population and activity of your gut. Microbes -they enhance immunity, rebuild the gut lining, help with absorption of minerals and produce anti-inflammatory compounds. Some people refer to prebiotics as the food that we provide for our gut bugs. If we eat lots of healthy plant-based fibre, we keep our gut microbes healthy and they can then help us.


==Make sure your diet includes lots of prebiotic foods, like beans and lentils and asparagus,
onions, garlic, leeks and beets. And increase your intake of probiotics through eating
more yoghurt and kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, tempeh, pickles, olives
and even dark chocolate.==

###### Prebiotics
Prebiotics are non-digestible fibre, which feeds our gut bacteria. Additionally, prebiotics enhance our immunity, absorption of minerals, and aid production of anti-inflammatory compounds. Foods high in prebiotics include lentils, beans, onions, leeks, garlic, asparagus and beets.

###### Probiotics
Probiotics are ‘good’ bacteria, found in both supplements and naturally in some foods. Foods rich in probiotics include fermented foods, such as yoghurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, natto, and tempeh, and fermented beverages, such as kombucha and kefir. By consuming probiotics, we can temporarily add these good bacteria to our gut microbiome.


Eating lots of whole-plant foods is a great way to improve the health of our gut microbes.

-   Rucklidge, Julia (August 3, 2019) "[Can mineral-vitamin treatment change the microbiome? Yes it can!](https://blogs.canterbury.ac.nz/science/2019/08/03/microbiome/)" University of Canterbury Science Blogs


Foods are less nutrient-dense than they used to be.
Because soils lack of nutriment, fertilizers lack of other minerals and selection for beauty and fast growing don't allow plant to add enought nutriment. 
Issus concern nutriment density. 

nutrient density problems in the soil in Canada.
Soil need remineralization. 
With climate change and the increase in Carbon, plant grow faster but without having the time to put all the nutriment (had beed shown in controled study).

There are many organisations around the world that track pesticides and other contaminants in food.  
Many national and local governments test samples of plant-based foods and publish scientific reports on their findings, for example:
-   European Union: [https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/pesticide-residues-food-track-trends-our-browsable-charts](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/pesticide-residues-food-track-trends-our-browsable-charts)
-   New Zealand: [https://www.mpi.govt.nz/food-business/food-monitoring-surveillance/food-residues-survey-programme/](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/food-business/food-monitoring-surveillance/food-residues-survey-programme/)
-   USA: [https://www.fda.gov/food/pesticides/pesticide-residue-monitoring-program-reports-and-data](https://www.fda.gov/food/pesticides/pesticide-residue-monitoring-program-reports-and-data)
-   California: [https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/enforce/residue/rsmonmnu.htm](https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/enforce/residue/rsmonmnu.htm)
-   Canada: [https://www.inspection.gc.ca/food-safety-for-industry/food-chemistry-and-microbiology/food-safety-testing-bulletin-and-reports/eng/1453324778043/1453327843364](https://www.inspection.gc.ca/food-safety-for-industry/food-chemistry-and-microbiology/food-safety-testing-bulletin-and-reports/eng/1453324778043/1453327843364)

A great initiative is the Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen list published each year by the Environmental Working Group ([www.ewg.org](http://www.ewg.org/)). It helps consumers know which fruits and vegetables are likely to have a high pesticide content. This can then help direct which ones are better to buy as organic.

#### Module 5 : Supplementation as treatment for mental health problems: The evidence.
objective: 
-   Describe the different ways one can study the effect of nutrients in research clinical trials
-   Discuss the breadth of research that has been conducted on broad spectrum micronutrients to support mental health
-   Explain how micronutrients in combination can be important through evaluating clinical trial evidence
-   Summarize the various side effects and cautions when taking micronutrients in a pill form


two very important concepts that often accompany nutrient supplementation: breadth and dose.
**Breadth** in the context of supplementation refers to how broad the supplement’s ingredients are, and how many different single nutrients it contains.
**Dose** refers to the amount of each nutrient that a multi-nutrient or single nutrient supplement contains.


If you're deficient in one nutrient, it is almost certain that you're deficient in many other nutrients, because they're so closely correlated in our diets.

One nutrient on its own, with a few rare exceptions, can't alleviate the suffering associated with a complex psychiatric disorder.

RDA's are set for healthy people and come from WW2, for mental ill people, the number may not be sufficient. 

it is best to consume multiple nutrients together, in balance, as nature intended. And in order to obtain a therapeutic effect in mental health, you may need to go over RDA. But don’t worry, that’s OK, as you learned in the video (and as illustrated in the diagram below), there is a big range above the RDA where we can consume a nutrient before it may become harmful.

"[Addressing the risk of inadequate and excessive micronutrient intakes: traditional versus new approaches to setting adequate and safe micronutrient levels in food](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309831/)s". _Food & nutrition research_, 59, 26020.


type of study: 
- Single case study, on subject
	- A B A B (on and off and on and off) -> explore the link of casuality.
- Case serie around 10 - 15 subject
	- open label design, everyone receive the intervention. 


![[EtudeType.png]]

**Case controlled studies** compare a group of individuals who received the new treatment with a group of matched individuals (that is matched by age, gender, and psychiatric disorder) who instead received a conventional treatment (such as a medication). This type of study can provide an estimate as to how effective the new intervention is relative to what is currently being offered for that condition.

Once a clear pattern has been established of a likely positive effect of a treatment, then a **randomized controlled trial (RCT)** is a desirable next step. These studies are highly controlled, and often very selective in who can enter the study. They usually (but not always) compare the intervention with a placebo, an active placebo or another established intervention. While they are often called the “gold standard,” it is important to not place all weight on RCT evidence as they don’t always reflect the typical patients who go to see a GP or psychiatrist for help.

Once a number of studies have been conducted on the same problem across multiple labs, then **systematic reviews** and **meta-analyses** can be done in order to obtain a good estimate of how powerful the treatment is likely to be. Combining many studies allows for a much larger sample size to provide a better estimate of the effect of the treatment.

Aggression is a symptom associated with many mental health disorders, including ADHD and Conduct Disorder. Changes in concentrations of certain micronutrients, such as zinc, have been shown to contribute to aggressive behaviour. It is possible that these behavioural issues in children (and even violent adults) could be partly explained by insufficient nutrients being available to the brain.

Mood disorder usually associate with serotonin a mood regulating neurotransmitter.
Research using micronutriment to treat it show people get calmer. 


Nutriment can also cure smoking + give better sleep. 

Our bodies are designed so that when we encounter a threat (either real or perceived), micronutrient-dependent functions needed for short-term survival (such as fight/flight) are prioritized over longer term functions (such as concentration and the regulation of your emotions). This is triage theory

Additional B vitamins, as a way to improve resilience in the face of everyday stress. Vitamine D help too. 

The most common side effects of too much Vitamine B reported are headaches, dry mouth and stomach aches, but these side effects do not occur more frequently than those taking a placebo.


_**cross-titration**_ to avoid increase of side effect while augmenting nutriment dosage. But always **talk with doctor first !!**


#### Module 6 : The bigger context: What can you do to build a better brain?
The best way to eat for optimal brain health is to focus on **eating real food first**.
A great place to start is by following Michael Pollan's guide: **eat food, mostly plants, not too much**.

#### What you'll learn in this Module:

When you’ve completed this module, you’ll be able to:

-   List practical steps to start eating well, such as how to shop cheaply, what foods to avoid, and acquiring nutrient dense foods
-   Experiment with some easy Mediterranean recipes
-   Summarize some basic steps to achieving better brain health

rules of tumbs, you want the raibow of color with fruit and vegetable. 
take meat that is closer to the bone for the nutriment. 

People intolerante to lactose, may be intolerante to A1 protein from the cow. Hense they can drink it from the sheep or the goat. 
try to eat 3 to 4 meal of fish of 120 to 150 grammes each for DHA and EPA and fatty cuts.

Example of mediterranean diet meal: bruschetta, caprese salad and homemade gnocchi
