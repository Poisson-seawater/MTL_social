# Lesson 1: The Major Scale
###### goal Lesson 1
-   Define harmony, ear training, and interval and explain why they are important in music.
-   Identify scale degrees, note names, and solfege.
-   Understand how to construct a major scale.
-   Understand how to useÂ sharps and flats to raise and lower the pitches of notes.
-   Identify major 2nd and major 3rd intervals.
-   Listen to a song and identify its tonal center or key.


### Why Are Harmony and Ear Training Important?
Ear Training -> see it as practicing a language. To learn and also understand; in order to open to another topic. 
Ear training is practical theory.

IF your ear's trained, you're able to identify what is going on,
THEN you're in a position to fix things, or make things better.
You're able to improvise better, because you understand
the harmony that's happening.

Harmony training -> is to learn how to speak music.


### Important Definitions

###### harmony
The study of chords, scales, and melodies.
Harmony study includes the analysis of chord progressions to show important
relationships between chords and the key a song is in.

###### Ear Training 
Identifying what you ear hears.
Ear Training make the connections between your musical mind, your ears, the sounds
around you, music notation, and your instrument.

###### Interval 
The distance between two notes. Including the 2 you press. 
So an octave is 8 interval.

###### Indentification
C D E F G A B C => note name
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 => scale degree
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do => solfege


and the line in which there are note => is a scale


### Structure of the Major Scale
A major scale is built with five whole steps (W) and two half steps (H). It work if use press the white key only or only the black key.

Half step is one key and it direct neightboor, so if
- white - black - white: whole step
- white - white : half step

Half step is where there is no black piano key between to neigthboor key. 
A half setp is aslo, white to black piano key if both are neigthboor, like C to C-sharp.


### Sharps and Flats
flat: to lower a note by a half step. C'est le *d* sur les partitions.
sharp: to raise a note by a half step. C'est le # sur les partitions.

note: C flat = B


### Major 2nd and Major 3rd Intervals

### Finding the Tonal Center
Tonal center is that predominant tone that you
hear when you're playing a progression or when you're playing a song.

It's like the anchor note that's played or that's heard. It's the note that keep coming back
The center of the tone, of the key that the song is in.

3 song that are in the key of C / song in the key of C major. 


# Lesson 2: Major and Minor Triads

### In This Lesson...

By the end of Lesson 2, you will be able to:
-   Identify Perfect 4th and Perfect 5th intervals.
-   Understand how to construct a triad and how to make a triad major or minor.
-   Identify the I-IV-V chord progression and understand how to compose a I-IV-V chord progression in the key of C Major.

### Perfect 4th and Perfect 5th Intervals
Perfect 4th and 5th just like other intervals can start from any note of course; as long as there is the right distance.

Identifying interval helps to hear training. 


### Building Major and Minor Triads
Triads is a chords
triad = 3 notes.

the number before chord, lie IV major triad = the number of the key we start the triade with. 

triad is made of a major third + a minor tird. That is 2 interval of 3. 

If the 2nd note press is the black key before (go down 1 half tone), the triads become a Minor Triad.

one of the major or minor is like a darker sound.
