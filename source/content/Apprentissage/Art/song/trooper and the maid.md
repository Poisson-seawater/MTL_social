A soldier lad came here last night
With riding he was weary
A soldier lad came here last night
And the moon was shining clearly
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
She's takes the trooper by the hand
And leads him to her chamber
She's given him some wine to drink
And his love it flared like tinder
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
They had not been in bed an hour
An hour but scarce a quarter
But the drums coming up the street
And then the beat was shorter
Its up, up, up, our colonel cried
It's up, up, up and away, then
It's up, up, up, our colonel cried
The morn's our battle day then
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
It's when will you come back again
My own dear soldier laddie
When will you come back again
And be your bairnie's daddy
Oh, hold your tongue my bonnie wee lass
Never let this parting grieve thee
When heather cows grow oxen bows
Bonnie lassie I'll come see ye
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
Bonnie lassie, will you gang with me
Bonnie lass, will ye lie near me
I'll get all your ribbons reel
In the morning ere I leave ye
