"And who are you?" The proud Lord said
"That I must bow so low"
Only a cat of a different coat
That's all the truth I know

**In a coat of gold or a coat of red**
**A lion still has claws**
**Mine are long and sharp, my lord**
**As long and sharp as yours**


*And so he spoke, and so he spoke*
*That Lord of Castamere*
*But now the rains weep o'er his hall*
*And not a soul to hear*

*And so he spoke, and so he spoke*
*That Lord of Castamere*
*But now the rains weep o'er his hall*
*And not a soul to hear*

*And so he spoke, and so he spoke*
*That Lord of Castamere*
*But now the rains weep o'er his hall*
*And not a soul to hear*

*and so he spoke*
*(That Lord of Castamere) Lord of Castamere*
*(But now the rains) weep o'er his hall*
*(And not a soul to hear)*
