Prick your finger, it is done
Turn your face into the sun
Roll her out and spread her wings
The time has come for better things
All down to Brisbane Harbour
Face the cold and bitter spray
Strain your muscles pine away
For the day we go ashore
To see the faces we adore
All down to Brisbane Harbour
So
Jump up Jack, get down
Jump up Jack, get down
Heave away your capstan, bullies
All aboard the flying Jenny
Down to Brisbane Harbour
Liza fair and Judy Lee
Balancing upon your knee
That gin and whiskey flowing free
A gentle breeze from off the sea
Right down to Brisbane Harbour
But boys, I know you are aware
Queensland girls are fierce and fair
That pretty hand upon your knee
Could be the last thing that you see
In good old Brisbane Harbour
So
Jump up Jack, get down
Jump up Jack, get down
Heave away your capstan, bullies
All aboard the flying Jenny
Down to Brisbane Harbour
Leviathan was on the deep
Around us nightly he would creep
Rose up like a bugaboo
And smashed a gunwale clean in two
All down to Brisbane Harbour
Huxley got him on his side
Dragged him around upon the tide
But he snatched up clean away
And lived to prowl another day
All down to Brisbane Harbour
So
Jump up Jack, get down
Jump up Jack, get down
Heave away your capstan, bullies
All aboard the flying Jenny
Down to Brisbane Harbour
Coral Sea is rolling strong
West wind batters us along
When upon the morning light
Fair Morton island hoves in sight
Down to Brisbane Harbour
11 weeks from Plymouth town
To the horn and straight around
But neither wind nor rolling tide
Can match the dangers here inside
Of good old Brisbane Harbour
So
Jump up Jack, get down
Jump up Jack, get down
Heave away your capstan, bullies
All aboard the flying Jenny
Down to Brisbane Harbour
Jump up Jack, get down
Jump up Jack, get down
Heave away your capstan, bullies
All aboard the flying Jenny
Down to Brisbane Harbour
