###### A contradiction is:
explicitly stating and taking a position opposite to one that is already made by your side; advancing claims that are mutually exclusive to the claims that have been advanced by your opening team, your partner, or earlier in your own speech.

###### A contradiction is not: 
A statement that is clearly pre-argumentative or mistakenly said (*i.e.something that can be deemed pre-argumentative, lacking the sufficient surrounding words to be a reason to support or not support the motion, which appears to contradict an argument that the speaker, their partner, or their closing member subsequently makes*). 

This is to avoid teams being unduly punished for a speaker mis-speaking and/or saying something otherwise inconsequential.



#### Contradictions within the same speech or within the same team
> Teams cannot be credited for two mutually exclusive claims.


They may only be credited for the first claim they have advanced. Subsequent claims which contradict or cannot coexist alongside the first claim should not be credited by the judges and opposing teams. 
Otherwise the team would get credit for two areas of mutually exclusive argument.


Plus, judges may also consider the extent to which the
contradiction has undermined the strength of the team’s arguments when determining the team’s contribution to the debate.

If either the speaker or the team directly contradicts themselves later in their speeches, this undermines their own points and should be taken into consideration during deliberation when determining how plausible their argument is, similar to as if an opposing team offered these arguments in refutation to the speaker.

While the later claim should be disregarded, judges should evaluate how the contradiction affected the persuasiveness of the first claim.

However, judges should not credit opposing teams unless they point out the contradiction. 

IF a speaker clearly mis-speaks at the start of their speech, and they correct it afterwards, 
THEN they should not have the rest of their speech discounted simply because it contradicts what they said first. 


Other than the instance of clear mis-speaking by the speaker, the argument made first should be considered to be the stance of the team, and later arguments that contradict the first argument should be discounted.



#### Contradictions between teams on the same bench
It is important to note that contradictions or refutations of an opening team's claims by their own closing team should not be considered when determining the strength of Opening's arguments or their level of persuasiveness.

Arguments made by a closing team that directly contradict their opening team's arguments should
be ignored by the judge *(i.e. the time spent by the closing speaker contradicting their opening
team, is equivalent to the speaker saying nothing at all)*.
This is to ensure that 
- all teams in the debate are treated fairly, as closing teams have a rulesbased
obligation to stay consistent with their opening teams. 
- debates are coherent and that teams are not forced to defend opposing claims or respond to contradictory cases.


###### Even if -> closing bench
Making an ‘even if’ argument (along the lines of “even if OO were wrong about this, we’re going to show that this motion should still be defeated”) does not constitute knifing. 
However, as with any other extension, an “even if” extension will not provide good grounds for a closing team win unless it improves the bench’s persuasive position.


##### How teams should deal with contradictions from the other side
It is good practice for teams to point out contradictions (if they exist) in the other side's case,
including between the two teams on the opposing bench. 

Whenever there is a contradiction, teams should consider the first claim to be the version they must engage with.


###### By way of example:
OG offers 2 claims which are mutually exclusive – claims A & B.
- Claim B (the later one) should not be credited by judges when evaluating the contribution of OG, however claim B can still weaken the persuasiveness of claim A. 
- When engaging with OG, other teams should consider claim A to be the line of argumentation OG pursues.
