Arguments can be stylistically impressive in a range of ways – crucially, “good style” should not be equated to “the sort of style admired in my debating circuit/culture”. 
- Speakers do not have “bad style” because they don’t speak with the particular idioms, mannerisms, coded references or established phrases used in the country their judge is from. 
- Crucially, judges must not discredit arguments because of the style or accent in which they were delivered, and will be in breach of [[Equity]] should they do so.

###### Accent
Judges have to understand the words a speaker says in order to evaluate them.
-  , a “strong accent” is not bad style. It's not a valid basis for judging certain styles as superior.
- The only way “accent” can be a problem is if judges genuinely cannot understand what the speaker is saying despite their very best efforts to do so.
- Same for speaking too fast to be understood – judges have to understand the words a speaker says in order to evaluate them.


There is  an obligation on all speakers to make themselves comprehensible to all judges and a burden on judges to do everything they can to understand a speaker’s words and meaning. 
- If judges cannot, despite their very best efforts, understand an argument, they cannot find it persuasive.

Worlds sets down a minimal number of principles to guide effective style that we take to be of fundamental and international applicability. As already noted, good style is about conveying reasons effectively.


Reasons are thus more compellingly delivered to the degree that:
- They are comprehensible. 
	- As noted, the speaker’s claims must be comprehensible to the judges to be evaluated. Technical jargon without explanation, speaking so fast you are incomprehensible, speaking so quietly you are not audible, slurring words, or fragmented sentences could all make an argument impossible to understand, and therefore could be unpersuasive.
	- To be clear: judges must make a dedicated effort to understand the speaker to the best of their ability, and must not automatically dismiss speeches as incomprehensible.
- They clearly and precisely convey the speaker’s meaning.
	- Vagueness, ambiguity and confusing expressions necessarily make judges uncertain over the nature of the reasons the speaker is offering and how they support the speaker’s argument.
	- The more clearly and precisely speakers can convey their reasoning, the more persuasive it is.
- They effectively convey the emotional, moral, practical or other significance of the speaker’s claim.
	- The key question a judge should ask themselves is: “Is there additional information being conveyed via this stylistic choice?” 
		- If yes: then the rhetoric has amplified the effect of the logical analysis, and should be credited as making the argument more persuasive.
		- If no: then the rhetoric has not been effective in conveying the significance of the logical analysis, and should not be credited as making the argument more persuasive.

Additional characterization, illustration and framing that emphasize the logic being presented can all contribute to the persuasiveness of the argument. Word choice, phrasing, complexity of language, intonation, and other stylistic choices are not credited in isolation. They are only credited insofar as they meaningfully add to your arguments (*for instance, using “delta” to replace the word “difference” does not meaningfully alter the content of your speech*).


It is tempting but wrong to think that arguments in debating can be assessed through pure, cold, emotionless logic unaffected by language or tone. 
Making and assessing arguments is impossible unless one attaches a certain significance to outcomes, principles or claims, and appropriate use of language and tone can convey such significance. 


It is crucial to note here that rhetoric cannot replace logical analysis - but rhetoric can amplify the effect of your logical analysis. Persuasive rhetoric does not necessarily need to be complex, so long as it communicates the significance of your point.

To reiterate: arguments cannot be persuasive just because they are stylish. Rather, style and analysis must work together to make an argument persuasive.
