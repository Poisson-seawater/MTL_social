>[!info] in a speach, have to listen to at least 1 POI !!
>but not necesarly answer it

###### Answering POI
Can answer POI with:
1. "We will get to that"
2. Ignoring it
3. Answering it seriously

### Rule of POI
- POI question have a limite of 15s. 
- Protect time <=> time without POI is 1st min and last minute.
- Etiquette of POI
- Point of Clarification


###### To offer a POI
Speaker should stand and say : 
- “point of information,” 
- “on that point” 
- or “point”. 

They should not offer “coded POIs” by uttering anything which reveals the content of the POI before it has been accepted (*by saying, for example “on the law” or “not at all!”*). 

IF the POI offered is refused, the speaker who offered it should sit down immediately.


#### Cutting off a POI
A speaker can cut off a POI before 15 seconds and resume their own speech (known as ‘cutting off’). Consequences:
- the debater delivering the POI must stop speaking, and sit down.
- the judge should assess whether this cutting off was legitimate. 
	- IF the POI was cut off before the point could be clearly made,
		- it may be appropriate to treat the speaker as though they had not taken the POI.
		- Because speakers cannot meaningfully engage with POIs if they do not allow their opponents sufficient time in which to ask the POI.

NOTE: If the person offering the POI does not stop speaking after 15 seconds, or after being cut off, 
THEN the judge should intervene by calling “order”.

#### Etiquette of POI
Wait 15s in between POI (reject of answer):
- barracking or badgering: act of persistently breaching this rule,
	- This is not permitted, as it is disruptive to the debate and unfair to the speaker.

POIs do not initiate a dialogue:
- after POI sits down.
- Then have to wait the required time to offer a new POI
	- The only exception to this is if the speaker was unable to catch the POI and asks the offeror to repeat or rephrase their question or comment. 

#### POI and last minute
At 6 minutes all speakers currently standing should sit down.

IF POI accepts BEFORE the 6 minute mark 
THEN it can continue past the 6 minute mark – it should continue until the POI is concluded.

Speaker CAN accept a POI offered before 6 minutes at the 6min mark maximum. 

BUT: Once all speakers are sitting after the 6 minute mark, no more POIs may be offered or accepted.

#### Points of Clarification
TO question the [[Prime Minister]] set up for the debate, *rather than make an argument ([[Leader of Opposition]]).* 

Point of Clarification function entirely as any other POI. 
- no obligation from PM
- ‘count’ as taking a POI – because it is a POI. 
- Points of clarification have no special status in the rules whatsoever, just the name change for clarity purpose
	- <=> say POC when talking !!


## Judging POI
It is the responsibility of judges to track and evaluate POI engagement during the round, which includes but is not limited to: 
- whether or not a speaker was offered POIs,
- whether or not a speaker accepted a POI, 
- the quality of the POI asked as well as the quality of the POI response.
- If a speaker has not accepted a POI, judges must remind the room to accept POIs after the speaker has finished speaking. 
- comment on POI engagement during their feedback to teams, and will be evaluated on this metric in judge feedback forms.

NOT answering POI can happen and will be judge according to the situation <=> it could penalize or not penalize the team.
