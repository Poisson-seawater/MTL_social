#New_moi/debat 

The analysis of an argument <=> reasons offered to support it. 


###### Reasons offered and accepted are:
- empirical evidence for an argument;
- giving mechanistic links for why a certain outcome will come about;
- identifying widely shared moral intuitions in favour of an argument;
- exposing a logical fallacy of a contrasting argument;
- identifying an emotive response that encourages us to care about a certain outcome;
	- identify Biais
- ...or doing various other things that encourage the ordinary intelligent voter to believe that an argument is true and important to the debate.

###### Criteria that reinforce Reasons:
-  the precision of what the speaker says and;
-  the detail with which relevant
	- logical claims, 
	- empirical evidence, 
	- causal processes, 
	- moral intuitions, 
	- logical implications 
	- or other elements are explained.


###### Judging and Analysis
Beyond these ways of identifying reasons within a speech that support arguments the speaker is
making, judges deploy very minimal standards in assessing the degree of support a reason gives,
whether the reason itself is plausible, and whether it therefore makes the speaker’s argument
persuasive. 
Seriously implausible claims (*such that any ordinary intelligent voter would not believe its logic and/or premises*) provide weak, if any, support for an argument.

Certain things do not matter (in themselves) in evaluating how good a speaker’s analysis was:
-  the number of arguments the speaker makes;
-  how clever/innovative the argument was;
-  how interesting the argument was;
-  arguments that you’re aware of but which weren’t made.

What matters, for an argument
- is how important its conclusion seems to be in the debate with respect to the burdens that each side is trying to prove, 
- and the extent to which it seems to be analysed and responded to (*and how well it withstood or was defended against such responses*).

Judges 
- do not consider how important they thought a particular argument was, in the abstract, 
- but rather how central it was to the overall contribution of any team or teams in this particular debate, 
- and how strong the reasons speakers offered to support the claim that it was important/unimportant were.
