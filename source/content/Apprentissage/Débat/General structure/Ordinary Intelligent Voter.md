Persuasiveness is highly subjective , the degree to which we are persuaded by something reflects 
- our existing beliefs, 
- our personal aesthetic 
- or stylistic preferences, our particular interests, 
- and so forth. 

It would be problematic if debating was judged so subjectively. SO, judges are asked to conceive of themselves as if they were a hypothetical ‘ordinary intelligent voter’ *(<=> ‘average reasonable person’ or
‘informed global citizen’*).


###### Facts, Knowledge and Special Language
The ordinary intelligent voter has the sort of knowledge you'd expect from someone who regularly reads, but does not memorise, the front pages and world section of a major international newspaper (like the New York Times or the Economist) in the year leading up to WUDC.

They do not read technical journals, specialist literature, or the like. They are, in short, a smart person who has a good deal of knowledge that is broad rather than deep. 
=> Imagine a bright and reasonably well-read university student who is studying a subject completely alien to any topic that would help them understand the debate in question.

While they may not know much on a specific topic by some debaters’ standards, the ordinary intelligent voter is genuinely intelligent, and understands complex concepts, facts or arguments once they're explained. 

While they may not know much on a specific topic by some debaters’ standards, the ordinary intelligent voter is genuinely intelligent, and understands complex concepts, facts or arguments once they're explained. 


Debaters may certainly make reference to examples, facts and details the ordinary intelligent voter is not aware of, but 
- they should **explain** rather than cite these examples, facts and details.
	- IF such examples are not explained beyond name-checking a country, THEN judges should discount material they do understand that the ordinary intelligent voter would not.
		- Judges should be bold in applying this rule: it is unfair on other teams in the room not to.
	- Wherever you are from, assume your judges are from somewhere else.

Following on from the above, the ordinary intelligent voter does not know technical terms that
one would require a particular university degree to understand. They can be assumed to possess
the sort of generalist vocabulary that comes from a university education of some sort, but probably
not from your specific degree. They do not have the sort of halfway-there economic or legal jargon
that we as debaters have become familiar with either. 
- Saying “Laffer curve” to most people is equivalent to making some clever sounding noises. 
- Similarly, using terms like ‘economic efficiency’ will lead to their being understood only as a layperson would grasp them, losing any technical specificity. 
- CCL: Judges should judge accordingly and speakers who wish to make use of the extra specificity that technical terms convey should take the time to explain the connotations of the terms they wish to use.



###### Dispositions
This hypothetical ordinary intelligent voter doesn’t have preformed views on the topic of the debate and isn’t convinced by sophistry, deception or logical fallacies. 

They are open-minded and concerned to decide how to vote – they are thus willing to be convinced by the debaters who provide the most compelling case for or against a certain policy. They do not judge debates based
on their personal beliefs or political convictions, nor do they enter a debate thinking that one side
is indefensible.
As described in the section above, they are well informed about political and social affairs but
lack specialist knowledge. They are intelligent to the point of being able to understand and assess
contrasting arguments (including sophisticated arguments), that are presented to them; but they
keep themselves constrained to the material presented unless it patently contradicts common
knowledge or is otherwise wildly implausible.




#### Judging as the Ordinary Intelligent Voter
As can perhaps already be intuited from the above paragraphs, the ordinary intelligent voter is
quite unlike most, or perhaps any, real world people. But the concept of the ‘ordinary intelligent
voter’ is a useful way of revealing a set of important characteristics that judges should aspire to
in order to ensure that all teams receive a fair hearing in any debate. As such, the term “ordinary
intelligent voter” describes the expectation that judges should:
- be aware of basic facts about the world (e.g.: “Syria is in the Middle East” would be
considered basic.);
- be familiar with issues and events that have made international headlines for a sustained
period of time (e.g. judges should be aware that COVID-19 is a pandemic and has had a
severe impact on many countries. They should be expected to know that different countries
had different models of response to COVID-19, with some countries deprioritizing the
economy and implementing lockdowns, and some countries prioritizing keeping the
economy open and relying on individual social distancing. They do not necessarily need to
be aware of the specifics of individual models each country has implemented.);
- avoid utilising personal knowledge that they have of the topic, unless it could reasonably
be assumed to be held by someone who fulfills the previous two criteria;
- give little credit to appeals merely to emotion or authority, except where these have
rational influence on an argument;
- avoid presuming a geographic, cultural, national, ethnic or other background when
assessing arguments;
- avoid preferencing arguments or styles of speaking that match personal preferences;
- assess the merits of a proposed policy, solution or problem separate from any personal
perspectives in relation to it.
This does not mean that speakers cannot make complex claims about complicated issues based on
their own specialized knowledge, or indeed, that judges cannot be convinced by these claims.
While judges should be assumed to have ordinary knowledge about various issues, they should also
be fully capable of logically following and analyzing a debate, and understanding complex
concepts when explained. If teams wish to bring in their own specialized knowledge to the debate,
they must be able to explain them in a way that is free of jargon and understandable by the
ordinary intelligent voter.
Thinking as the ordinary intelligent voter does not absolve us from our responsibilities to actually
judge the debate – to evaluate the logical flow of arguments, determine the extent to which teams
have seemed to win them, and ensure that they have done so within the rules. We should not say
“while that was clearly irrational rabble-rousing, the ordinary intelligent voter would have fallen
for it”. This not only leads to irrational conclusions, but also, generally, overestimates how much
cleverer we are than an ordinary intelligent voter.
We emphasise that a key reason for judges to imagine themselves as the ordinary intelligent voter
is to avoid relying on their subjective tastes as well as their subjective beliefs. Many of us debate
a lot, and we develop aesthetic preferences about speaking as well as in-jokes and references

which we find terribly funny. This is natural, but distracts somewhat from debating. As voters we
are much less likely to credit policies for being advocated in a “sophisticated” or “funny” way.
Judges should remember that they are not aiming to evaluate who was cleverest, neatest or
funniest, but who best used their cleverness, neatness and funniness to persuade us that the policy
was a good or a bad idea.
