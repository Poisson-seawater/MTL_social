Rebuttal: matterial offered by a speaker to demonstrate why the adverse's team argument are 
- wrong, irrelevant, 
- AND comparatively unimportant, 
- TO win the debate.


###### Rebuttal 101
Rebuttal does not, need some special sort of argument or analysis. It simply refers to any material that engages directly with arguments raised by the other side.

Rules of thumbs:
- advise to explicitly say "rebuttal"
- it can occur at the beginning, end, middle or through the entirety of a speech. 
- Rebutal can be use to rebut and construct and argument
	- Material labelled as rebuttal can be constructive as well as rebuttal, 
	- And material labelled as constructive can also function as rebuttal.


###### Rebutal and Judging
Judges should track the argument and assess, given their responses to each other, which team's contribution was more significant in furthering their cause to logically persuade us that we should do the policy, or that we should not.

But where teams don't get a chance to rebut others, determining who was more persuasive is trickier. This happens fairly often, for example:
-  between teams on diagonals
-  when the Opposition Whip explains something in a new way
-  when opening teams are shut out of POIs

In these circumstances judges are forced to perform some more independent assessment of the arguments made. Judges will have to assess not only which arguments are most important, but also which ones are most clearly proven. 


KEEP IN MIND: Arguments that require the judge to make numerous logical leaps are better than no arguments at all but are not preferable to a well-reasoned argument that rests on fewer unsubstantiated assumptions.
