"Burden" refers to the responsibility that each side of the debate carries. 


##### Intro
The burden of proof refers to providing more convincing arguments to win the debate:
- **Burden of Proposition (Government):** Demonstrating why "the motion" should be accepted with a strong and persuasive case
- **Burden of Opposition:** The Opposition carries the burden of refutation; 
	- Challenge the arguments presented by the proposition, showing the weaknesses
	- and explaining why the motion should not be accepted.

It's about providing a more compelling case than the opposition to win the debate. The opposition's role is to create doubt, question the government's arguments, and provide reasons for not accepting the motion.


### Attributing the Burden
There are two key ways that a burden can legitimately be attributed to a team
- burden may be implied by the motion itself
- burden can be set by specific analysis made by the teams
- *and speakers may point out such burdens, then explain why they or other teams need to meet them*.

NOTE: The way Opening Government defines the motion may affect these burdens.



#### First, a burden may be implied by the motion itself. 


##### Exemple
“This House would prioritise the vaccination of law-abiding citizens in the case of major epidemics”, 

###### government teams:
- need to demonstrate that in major epidemics the vaccination of law-abiding citizens should be prioritised. 
- AND; do not need to demonstrate
	- that vaccinations of law-abiding citizens should be prioritised in general
		- (*outside of major epidemics*), or
	- that only law-abiding citizens should be vaccinated 
		- (*law-abiding citizens should simply be prioritised*).

###### Opposition team:
- Need to demonstrate that Government are wrong: 
	- -> that the policy of prioritising law-abiding citizens for vaccination in major epidemics should be opposed. 
- Do not need to show that law abiding citizens should not be prioritised in any way under any conditions.

#### Second, burdens can also be set by specific analysis teams take up. 

##### Exemple
“This House believes that assassination is a legitimate tool of foreign policy”, 
- [[Leader of Opposition]] may initially argue that 
	- assassination is a severe breach of international law. 
		- BURDEN (so argument become relrelevant to the debate)
		- show that: illegality matters for illegitimacy. 
- This burden would be at risk if 
	- the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] states that they accept that assassination is illegal, 
		- but argues that illegality is a poor basis for believing an act illegitimate.
- Forcing the [[Deputy Leader of Opposition]] to provide superior reasons (*more Burden*) to think that
	- the illegality of an act under international law is a reason to deem it **illegitimate**, 
		- and: it is not relevant to the burdens to  
			- say assassination is illegal,
			- or providing more detail on how it is illegal. 
	- BECAUSE both sides now agree that assassination is illegal 
		- but Disagree on the implications:  
			- assassination’s **legitimacy**, and this idea of **legitimacy** is the now burden to prove.
