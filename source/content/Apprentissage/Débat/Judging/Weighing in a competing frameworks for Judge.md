#New_moi/debat 

Teams will dispute the criteria by which the round should be adjudicated on. To so, they argue on the frameworks and standards that will determine the points of their argument.  

For example “*This House would invade North Korea*”
- IF Opposition ==successfully proves== that
	- “war is always wrong, regardless of the **practical** benefits” 
		- *(they must do more than assert it)*, 
- THEN: 
	- IF Government want to advance purely **practical** reasons in favour of the invasion.
		- They need first to offer reasons to: "believe that a **practical** calculus is relevant"

#### TIPS

> Have to link them to utility maximisation.


Common form of mistake 
- is to assume a utilitarian framework *(“what leads to the best consequences”)*.
- disregard principled argumentation explaining that particular effects are more important than others *(for reasons unconnected with utility maximisation.)*

Take away for judges
- should listen to teams’ arguments about 
	- what our aims and principles should be,
	- and evaluate the claims of harms or benefits in that context.
- BECAUSE: this can make the claims about how we should determine the right policy particularly vital, and they may fundamentally reshape team’s burdens in the debate.


### Judging
Judges should adjudicate this debate about criteria given. Which is resum in 2 scenario:
- all team agree on a mesurement: explicitly or implicitly 
	- *ex: saving life*
- no agreeement

###### The Scenario explain
- IF there one criterion or principle that all teams  agree is **true and important**? 
	 - explicitly
		- *E.g. all teams explicitly agree that their goal is to save the most number of lives, and the debate is about the best way to do so*
	- implicitly  
		- *E.g. while no team explicitly articulates that their goal is to save the most number of lives, all the analysis advanced by teams points in this direction*
	- THEN judge from this criteria or principle
- IF not, which team has successfully proven one criteria to be the most true and important
	- *I.e. If no team agrees on one criterion, and all teams are asserting different metrics, which team has provided the best reasons to believe that their metric is the most important one in the round?*
- IF: neither aggreement nor better argue
	- THEN judge based on what the Ordinary Intelligent Voter would take to be important. This should be a last resort measure only, as it is very rare that none of the aforementioned scenarios would apply.

#### Regarding Weighting clashes
Judges should generally be wary of considering an argument completely irrelevant because of a principled framework advocated by their opponents. 
BECAUSE: It is very unlikely that any team will ever prove their view of the appropriate criteria to be completely and undeniably true and that, arguments which do not fit those criteria should be completely dismissed out of hand. 
-> It is thus often more appropriate to treat arguments as less persuasive when they rest on criteria which another team have suggested are not relevant, rather than ruling them out completely.
