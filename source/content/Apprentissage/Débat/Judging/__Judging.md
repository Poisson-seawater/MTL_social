### Mc Gill club rule
At the beginning of the debate, please offer the opportunity for debaters and judges to share their pronouns if they’re comfortable, and if they aren’t, please refer to them using gender neutral pronouns

###### Judge Mindset
As a judge, you should have the perspective of a “globally informed citizen” - someone who reads major newspapers on a daily basis. 
Aka, the average reasonable voter.

Judges should NOT let their own biases/opinions of arguments influence how they judge teams in the debate. They also should not let their pre-existing
knowledge on a topic influence their judging, aside from two scenarios:
- The debater makes an obviously factually flawed claim that the globally informed citizen would be aware of 
	- *i.e. claiming that Stephen Harper is the current prime minister*
- The argument is constructed in a way that it is not convincing - the logic is absurd, the claim is not properly substantiated with reasoning, no globally informed citizen would believe the claim

The metric is: **“Which team provided the most persuasive argument for their side of the debate, from the perspective of an informed global citizen?”**. 
This can be adjudicated based on:
- Plausible reasons that are offered to show an argument is true and important (analysis/content/weighing)
- Plausible refutation as to why an argument is not true/not important
- Clarity and rhetorical power used to explain these reasons (style)

Note: as a judge, you should NOT intervene in the debate - even if you think an argument is not true, unimportant, etc.  -> you should not **discredit** it unless another team in the debate has proven that it is such. 
Furthermore, you should p**rioritize content and
analysis over style** when adjudicating.

Some more general things to keep in mind:
- Compare all teams directly: 
	- for example, contributions from a closing team should not factor into whether OG beat OO or vice versa
- Judge the debate holistically:
	- there are no “automatic” wins or losses 
	- IF a speaker doesn’t fill time and/or  their role adequate, etc. 
		- THEN Judge the contributions of the team to the debate, and apply the same standards to all speakers
- Do not credit some arguments more than others UNLESS debaters in the round explicitly give you reason to do so. 
	- For example, you should not credit practical arguments more than principle ones unless you hear sufficient weighing from speakers as to why you should do this. 
	- This also applies to comparing “left wing” vs “right wing” arguments, “structural” vs. “empirical” arguments, etc.
- Simply delivering new material isn’t sufficient to award the debate to a closing team.
	- Their material also needs to be better in some way


##### POIs and engagement
Debates are not just judged by the arguments made, but by the way in which the teams engage with one another. One critical form of engagement is through POIs:
- Each speaker should accept at least one POI. On a close split between two teams, whether or not one has accepted a POI is a legitimate reason to decide which should rank higher
- POIs should be a maximum of 15 seconds long; the content after the 15 seconds should not be credited

##### How NOT to judge
- Penalty judging (automatic 4s because a speaker didn’t fill time, got a fact wrong, etc.)
- Judging on role fulfillmen
	- Role fulfillment is only important insofar as it allows a team to be engaged and comparative. i.e. Although OG should set a clear model, these are not absolute reasons as to why that team does well
- Judging based on number of arguments offered
- Judging based on biases (for instance, ESL bias, accents, pitch of voice)
- Assuming debates are set in Canada/America when the motion does not explicitly say so / deprioritizing “international” examples
- Using subjective assessments of style. Style should only be reflective of clarity, precision, comprehensibility, and conveyance of emotional/moral/practical significance of a speaker's’ argument



### Judging basic
Criteria for Ranking Teams, judges should consider all of the following criteria when making decisions about how to rank teams in the rounds:
- Did the teams/speakers meet their responsibilities in the debate round?
- Were the arguments presented by the teams clearly explained, well supported, and relevant to the topic?
- Did the speakers organize and deliver their speeches in a persuasive manner?

###### No Automatic “1st” or “4th” in a Round
While it is crucial for judges to consider the quality of arguments presented during the debate round, it is also important to understand that no one argument can result in an automatic “1” in the debate round. Individual teams and speakers should be given credit for bringing convincing arguments into the debate, but adjudicators must consider the body of a team’s work when ranking the teams. In addition, there are no arguments or actions in a round that should result in an automatic “4” in the debate round. There are certainly some approaches that can and should hurt a team’s final ranking (*i.e. A first government team that sets up an unclear debate or a second half team that “knifes” the opening team on their side*), but once again the judges should consider the body of a team’s work when deciding on final rankings.
