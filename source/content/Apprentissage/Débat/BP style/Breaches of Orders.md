Any of the following activities are considered to be disrupting the debate:
- Barracking/badgering
- Continuing to offer a POI after being cut off by the speaker speaking or by the Chair
- Offering POIs in any way other than those described in Section 1.4 when not delivering a speech or a POI
- Speaking beyond 7 minutes with a 15 second grace period
- Talking in an audible volume or otherwise generating distracting noise during another speaker’s speech
- Engaging in other highly distracting behaviour
- Using props (any physical object, diagram, etc.)


These are not only breaches of the rules and/or appropriate debate conduct as it is commonly
understood but are also breaches of order. Unlike other breaches of the rules (which simply
damage a team’s chance of getting a good result in the debate), breaches of order should be
enforced by the Chair of the debate by calling order.

###### Calling Order
When the Chair of a debate utters “order”, it is a demand that all speakers immediately cease any of the breaches of order listed above. This should not happen often. Provided debaters adhere to the call to order, no further action is taken. A Chair should never call order for a breach of the rules which is not a breach of order.


###### Stopping the Clock
In exceptional circumstances. 

Once this has been done, the Chair should check that the speaker is ready to resume the speech, call for the clock to be restarted, and allow the speaker to continue their speech from the point at which the clock was stopped.
