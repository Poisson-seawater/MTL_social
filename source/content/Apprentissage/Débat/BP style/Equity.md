As well as following the rules of BP debating, Worlds also requires that all participants adhere to the tournament ‘Equity Policy’. 

Equity violations are not a standard part of debating that should be expected from time to time. On the contrary, they shzould never occur at a tournament. Debating is here for the enjoyment of participants, and not really worth people falling out with each other over.

### Regarding Judges and Equity 
Judge 
- have no authority to enforce the equity policy (
	- but must obviously themselves follow it. 
	- they may not cut off a speaker for a perceived breach of equity 
		- except, where an equity violation have disrupted the round and intervention is required to restore order. 
- Judges should not take the fact that they believe an equity violation has occurred into account when assessing who won a debate, or what speaker points to award.
	- Because Judges are there to judge the debate, and should only penalise equity violations to the extent to which they make a speaker unpersuasive and/or are unfair on other teams or speakers. 
	- HENCE, Judges cannot award a speaker zero speaker marks, or give their team an ‘automatic fourth’ on the basis of a breach of equity.

To resolve equity violations formally, debaters and/or judges should report them to the equity team who, in consultation with the Adjudication Core and the person making the complaint, will decide what course of action, if any, needs to be taken.
