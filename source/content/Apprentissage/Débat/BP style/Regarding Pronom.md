 >You should not assume people pronoun. 

IF a speaker don't stay pronoun
THEN all other participants in the room should use gender neutral language,:
-  ‘speaker’ or ‘Prime Minister’ or ‘adjudicator’


IF speaker say pronoun
THEN 
- All participants should take note of the pronoun of each speaker and use that pronoun to refer to them (if applicable).
- As the chair introduces each speaker, the chair can remind the room of the speaker’s pronoun (if applicable). For example, the chair might say: 
	- “I now invite the government member x, pronoun they.”
- If you mistakenly use the wrong pronoun, please apologise. 
	- Disregard for a person’s gender pronoun may be treated as an equity violation.
