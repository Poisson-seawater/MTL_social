### Speech sheet
###### Pre-made sentence
1st sentence: Thank you for having us
last sentence: so we win

###### Structure 
Review 1 or 2 **theme** abord during the motion
1. Explain choice of theme
	1. really fast, couple of sentence. 
	2. it's the Introduction of the Whip speach
2. For each theme: 
	1. organize the clashing made:
		1. [[Member Speeches]] argument
		2. what's been say by the 3 other teams. 
	2. then explain why we win.
		1. rebute other side argument 
		2. the depth of your team 1 argument and what [[Member Speeches]] add
			1. regarding your side arguments
	3. then use [[Weighting - Impact|impact]] to explain WHY your side win
		1. explain the metric they use 
		2. why it's useless
			1. regarding the statu quo of the motion or as a solving the problem
		3. add our metric 
			1. why it's a better metric.

Separate: 
1. [[Member Speeches]] argument
2. what's been say by the 3 other teams. 

Why separate: to explain why your team argument matter more by [[Weighting - Impact|weighting]].



**theme**: they are made out of argument. Theme is absolutly decide according to our opinion
- *ex: if argument about GDP, housing crisis and education* 
	- -> *theme = economy*
- *ex: if argument about happiness, equal opportunity*
	- -> theme = social

Compare their weighting to our weighting. Then explain why our matter more.



### Role - Whip 101
Whip: 
- note the major disagreements in the debate (points of clash) between the two sides and
- will make use of the best arguments from each team on their side to make their case that the motion ought to be affirmed or rejected. 
- explain why their own team’s contributions are the most persuasive or important on their bench
- add persuasive material to the debate
	- such as weighting
- no kniffing !!

Break the debate down to the judge to show why you win
- Either organized in clashes/themes 
	- *e.g. “What’s best for victims?”*
- OR team by team
	- *e.g. compare your case to the 3 other teams one by one*
- ==Do analyze and weigh==
Refutation and rebuilding integrated into comparisons

DO NOT 
- SUMMARIZE!!
	- you make a BIAIS explaination on why your team - is better.
- give new arguments!!!


what the Whip can do, that are not considere argument:
- new defences of arguments already made
- new explanations of previously-made arguments
- new rebuttal
- new examples to support existing arguments
- new explanation regarding the impact or prioritization of existing lines of argumentation AND
- anything the other side can reasonably be expected to understand that team intended from their Member speech.



### Judge notation
IF a team does make a new argument in the Whip speech, judges should simply ignore it, and not afford it any credit.

Judge will judge you on: how you use the [[Member Speeches]] from your team side to weight in your favor.

At times, it's difficult to assess the difference between new rebuttal and analysis (*which is permitted*) and new arguments (*which are not*). 
- Judges should consider whether or not the making of the claim raises 
	- a new issue or approach to winning the debate on an existing issue, to which the other side has little if any ability to respond.
