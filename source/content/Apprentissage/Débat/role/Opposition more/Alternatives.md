#New_moi/debat 

Arguments that suggest a range of viable alternative arguments and solutions are not the same as advancing a counter-proposition.

Opening Opposition also has the right to point to a variety of possible superior alternatives without committing to a counter-proposition. However, this is not the same as advancing a counterprop:
-  Providing a range of possible alternatives is not the same as providing a specific mechanism that the Opposition bench as a whole must commit to, whereas a counter-prop is a specific mechanism that CO must abide by.
- Opposition teams do not have fiat power when advancing alternatives, and Government teams may question the feasibility of suggested alternatives.
- Providing a range of possible alternatives may affect the persuasiveness of OG’s arguments, but does not necessarily alter the comparative in the debate, whereas a counter-prop alters the comparative in the debate

Alternatives, like any other argument, must be proven superior in some way in order to be winning lines. Their mere existence is not sufficient for the team advancing the alternatives to win.

Winning alternatives should be:
- Detailed and substantiated – vague and unsubstantiated alternatives are evaluated in the same way vague and unsubstantiated arguments are (i.e. they are found to be unpersuasive).
- Mutually exclusive to OG’s model – otherwise, they should be evaluated similarly to all other non-exclusive material in the round.

For example,:
- if Opening Opposition claims only that they can “regulate”, this will be significantly less persuasive than explaining 
	- how they might regulate and 
	- why this regulation is likely to be effective. 
- if Opening Opposition claims “This money can be better invested in other areas, like hospitals or charities!”,  this argument is unpersuasive unless OO can explain both 
	- why the money cannot be invested in these areas in OG’s case and 
	- why the money is likely to be invested in those areas.
