A definition may also be invalid if it is a ‘squirrel’.
A ‘squirrel’ is a definition of the motion 
- which seeks to diminish or evade the burden of proof the motion places on Opening Government.
- that is literally inconsistent with the words of the actual motion that was set.
- that is not debatable. 
	- For instance, if the motion is “THR the use of feminist messaging in commercials”, it would be illegitimate to claim that this debate is only about negative instances of feminist messaging in commercials as this unfairly limits the scope of the debate by making it tautological.

If teams make arguments purely based on a squirrel, and their squirrel is challenged, then their
arguments may be called into question as well. However, if teams make arguments that may apply
to both the squirreled definition as well as a legitimate definition, then their arguments should be
judged based on the content of the argument.
