#New_moi/debat 

If the definition provided by the OG is invalid, then it can be challenged, during the Opposition Leader’s speech. 

The only grounds for claiming that a definition is invalid is 
- if it meets one of the two squirrelling circumstances outlined above, 
- or if it unfairly restricts the time and place of the debate. 
- It is not enough for a definition to not seem “in the spirit of the motion”, or for a definition to have not been expected by other teams in the debate.

If a team challenges the definition, they must argue that the definition is illegitimate and explain why. In challenging the definition, the Opposition Leader has two choices:
1. Firstly, they can complain about the motion having been defined in an invalid way but proceed to debate it anyway. 
	1. This is preferable if the motion proposed is not a fair reading of the motion but is still debatable. 
	2. The debate then proceeds and is judged as per normal.
2. Secondly, they can challenge the definition and redefine it. 
	1. They should tell the judge and the other debaters what a proper definition would be and should then proceed to argue against that case. 
	2. Where a team takes this option, it is advisable in some cases (though not required) for them to present ‘even-if’ analysis engaging with the OG’s definition of the motion and the material that stems from that definition, as well as their own.

Judges should not punish teams just for having a ‘definitional debate’. However, if teams engage in unnecessary definitional debates over reasonable definitions, this should be treated as selfpenalizing as they are wasting time on unpersuasive material at the
cost of relevant arguments.


Where a definition falls within one of the circumstances outlined above, it is often still advisable for a team to debate the motion as it has been defined, and avoid the procedural complexity of a definitional challenge taking away from their time to present substantive arguments.


Note that a definition cannot be attacked merely for being “the status quo”. 
Most motions will ask Government to defend the implementation of some sort of policy, which is likely to involve changing the world from the way it is at present. As such, if OG actually propose something which is identical to the status quo, this might be symptomatic of Government failing to define the motion properly.
- some motion may propose the statue quo in some country -> it's alright as it is still many change for other country + give example.
