#New_moi/debat 

“Counter-proposition”: refers to a specific
policy, or model, promoted by the Opening Opposition. This course of action should only be undertaken when the motion type allows for a policy debate.

When advancing a counter-proposition, Opening Opposition teams enjoy the same level of fiat as Opening Government.

Counter proping: 
- must be mutually exclusive with the model proposed by the Prime Minister. 
- alters the comparative in the debate, 
	- all teams need to compare the policy proposed by the Government with the counter-prop (rather than with status quo). 
- THEN teams advance arguments about the benefits and harms of both proposed models.
