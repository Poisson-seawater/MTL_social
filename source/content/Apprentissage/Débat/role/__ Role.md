### Speaker Roles:
Generally, each team's job is to make arguments and respond to things said by other teams.

Within each team: 
 - **==First speakers==** (PM, LO, MG, MO) are generally tasked with making arguments. 
	 - On front half, that's usually 1-3 arguments.
	 - On back half, usually 1 argument 
		 - because you need to prove 
			 - WHY 
				 - what you're saying is **different** from front half 
				 - it's **better** than what they said. 
		-  WHY ? It's easiest when you focus on adding one new point instead of multiple
	- In practice, this means that every first speaker is doing about
		- 70% building argumentation and 30% refutation, 
		- except for the PM 
			- since they speak first in the debate, so there's no one before them to refute, hence the 30% is modeling.

- **==Second speakers==** are generally focused 
	- on refutation (*attacking the other side's arguments*)
	- AND rebuilding 
		- responding to the other side's attacks on their arguments 
		- and adding analysis to their points / explaining why their arguments matter the most -> [[Weighting - Impact]]
	- the second speakers on front half (DPM and DLO) are allowed to make new arguments,
		- but this is not always advised and should be done only sparingly, 
		- because it can risk these speakers not leaving enough time to refute and rebuil
	- On back half ([[Whip]]) are not allowed to introduce any new arguments. 
		- Their jobs, while often referred to as "giving biased summaries of the round", are generally to compare their partner's argumentation to each of the other teams' material. 
		- This should involve direct clash (e.g. refutation) with teams on the opposite side. 
		- However, when comparing to the other team on their side (their opening/front half team),
			- they are not allowed to disagree with them (this is called 'knifing'). 
			- Instead, they must differentiate their argument and then weigh against their front half, arguing that front half was correct but didn't go far enough or didn't give as good a reason to support your side of the motion

### Role
Each team has a role and each speakers should fulfil that role:
- OG should
	- define the motion,
	- advance arguments in favour of their side, 
	- and rebut arguments made by OO.
- OO should 
	- rebut OG's case (*i.e. the general set of arguments they have offered*)
	- and advance constructive arguments as to: why their side of the table should win the debate.
- Closing Half: should provide further analysis in favour of the motion, which should be consistent with, but distinct from, the substantive material advanced by OG/OO. 
	- Further analysis can take the form of 
		- substantive material,
		- refutation, 
		- framing, c
		- haracterization, 
		- or any kind of material meant to advance the Government/Opposition case.

### Role Fulfilment
IF role not fulfil, 
THEN team are penalize. 


It is not a role-fulfilment requirement for the Deputy Prime Minister or Deputy Opposition Leader to add new material (whether arguments, analysis, rebuttal, etc.) to the debate. OG and OO teams are within their rights to concentrate all their constructive arguments within their opening speeches and leave the Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Opposition Leader to reiterate, reconstruct, reword or summarise the Prime Minister or Opposition Leader’s contributions 
-> judges should not punish teams for doing this in and of itself. 

But such a strategy may be inadvisable. Since BP debating involves four teams, judges are centrally tasked with comparatively assessing the extent and importance of the persuasive contributions made by each team. Merely repeating or reconstructing a partner’s material, whilst of some value, is rarely if ever more valuable than actually adding new arguments or analysis. In addition, it makes the closing half team’s job much easier, by potentially leaving them more material to use to extend the debate.
