Motions that begin with “This House, as [A], would do [X]” are somewhat special. 

These motions are more specific about the entity (A) doing (X) and so invite a closer examination of the perspective of the entity about what they should do, with all teams arguing from actor A’s perspective. 

Teams debating these motions should therefore consider what actor A’s knowledge, values and interests are, and explain why the motion is or is not in actor A’s best interest. Unlike previously discussed debates, actor debates are not about whether or not X action is necessarily best for the world.


It is important to note at this point that prioritizing actor A’s perspective is not the same as assuming that actor A only cares about their own interests. Most, if not all, actors hold moral beliefs and principles, and will act to actualize those beliefs. Thus, debaters should feel free to make principled arguments in actor debates, in addition to more practical arguments, so long as they are also able to explain why the actor in question holds those specific principled beliefs. 

So if, for example, the motion is “TH, as a parent, would not send their child to private school,” this debate should take place from the perspective of a parent, as both the proposed agent to make a decision about the education of their child and the proposed target of argumentative appeals. (By contrast, if the motion is “THBT parents should not send their children to private schools”, the motion does not take place solely from the perspective of the parent– instead, the debaters are simply trying to convince the judges of the truth of the statement from a neutral perspective.) 


In such a debate, Government teams would first have to explain what the interests of a parent are, and then explain why not sending their child to a private school meets those interests. The interests of the parent can be practical (e.g. wanting their child to succeed materially in life) or principled (e.g. a broad interest in the principle of equality). 

Opposition teams can do two things:
- they can either agree with Government teams about the interests of the parent, 
	- and argue that the proposed course of action does not meet those interests, 
- or they can argue that parents have different interests than the interests raised by the Government team, and that this new set of interests can be better met by sending their child to private school.
