Motions of the form “This House Would [do X]” involve Government arguing that they should be
enacting policy X.
A policy is a concrete course of action that Government teams wish to convince the judges should be implemented. Such motions are about whether the House should do X – with Government teams arguing that they should and Opposition teams arguing that they should not.


These debates are purely normative. They do not require teams to discuss whether or not policy X is likely to be enacted in the real world, or whether or  ot policy X is currently status quo.

-> the debate is about whether they should or should not do a policy, not whether their real world counterparts will or will not. 
It should be assumed that the policy will be implemented in the manner that the Government teams set up (also known as Government fiat). As such, it is never a valid line of opposition to such motions to state that “but the government would never do this” or, more subtly, “but politicians would never pass this law”.


The debate should assume that the Government team has the power to implement such a policy and that this policy will therefore pass the approval of Congress or Parliament; however, the Government team cannot control reactions to this policy, and cannot assume that everyone will behave in a compliant manner once the policy is passed. The question of the debate is whether or not the policy should be enacted in the manner that the Government team has set out.

For Policy motions, Opposition teams may choose to defend status quo, or propose an alternative
in the form of a counter-proposition (see section 2.10). It is not necessary for Opposition teams to
present a counter-proposition, though it may be beneficial in some instances.
If presenting a counter-proposition, Opposition teams are granted the same amount of fiat power
that Government teams have: the debate should assume that whatever counter-proposition
Opposition proposes will also be implemented, and it would be similarly futile to argue that
Opposition’s counter-proposition would never be passed by any parliament in real life. However,
it is crucial to note that Opposition’s counter-proposition should not take significantly more
resources to achieve than Government’s policy. More information can be found in the section on
[[counter-propping]].
