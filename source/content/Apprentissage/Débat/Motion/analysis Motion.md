### TH believe
Motions that begin with “This House believes that [X]” are value judgment debates. They require Government teams to argue for the truth of the statement represented by X, whilst Opposition teams argue that X is false. There is no need for Government teams to implement a model.


Exemple: “THBT there is no moral obligation to follow the law”. 
Government teams need not have a model; they should, however, still define terms within the debate. In this case, they should define what a moral obligation is.


### TH should
Motions that begin with “THBT [X] should...” are about whether or not the statement is true from the perspective of a neutral observer.
- Even though these motions are phrased as true or false statements, Government teams are encouraged to implement a model. 

Take as an example the motion “THBT the US should sanction Saudi Arabia.” While it is possible for teams to debate the merits and demerits of sanctions in abstract, the debate would be made much clearer if Government teams present a model outlining what sanctions entail, what kinds of sanctions would be implemented, and so on.
Similar to policy debates, Opposition may also propose an alternative ([[counter-propping]]). These motions should not be confused with actor motions.


### TH supports/opposes 
Motions that begin with “This House supports/opposes [X]” also usually need not involve Government proposing a model. 

Instead, the Government teams need to argue that they would either symbolically, politically, materially or in some other manner support the person, group, institution, cause, idea, value, or statement expressed by X.
Opposition need to argue that X should not be supported in that way.

Take, for example, the motion “THS US involvement in the Middle East.” Government teams must argue that US involvement is positive in totality, without picking and choosing which aspects of this motion they are supporting. 
Similarly, Opposition teams must oppose this motion in totality, without picking and choosing what to oppose. Teams cannot support only favourable aspects of US involvement, nor can they oppose only unfavourable aspects of US involvement.

Secondly, Government cannot model how US involvement will occur. They can argue that US involvement is likely to happen in a certain way, but this characterization is open to challenge by the other teams. In other words, Government has no fiat power in THS / THO debates.


### TH prefer
Here Opposition teams are bound to defend the specific comparison provided by the motion. They must either:
- In motions phrased THP X to Y: defend Y or
- In motions phrased THP X: defend status quo.

#### THP a world in which
Debaters should be aware that there is a unique version of THP motions, which are phrased “THP a world in which X”. These types of motion set a burden on Government to envision and argue in favour of the alternate world described in the motion. 
While Opposition is still bound to defend the status quo, or whatever comparison is presented in the motion.

In the motion “THP a world in which organized religion does not exist”, Government needs to conceptualize an alternative world without organized religion. This motion is also backwards looking: it requires teams to consider how the world would have developed had organized religion never existed. Here, it is reasonable to expect the debate to contain some discussion of how the trajectory of human history or development would have been impacted. This is similar to how counterfactuals work in TH Regrets motions.

As these debates require the conceptualization of an alternative world, arguments about transitions between the status quo and the alternative world are not permissible.

*For example, using the previous motion, teams should not discuss backlash from the demise of organized religion, as organized religion would have never existed in this alternative world. Debaters should also use their common sense to determine the point at which this new world diverged from the status quo. 

*For example, some motions mention the introduction of a new technology. It would, in most cases, be unreasonable for teams to assume that this technology existed 2000 years ago. It would be more reasonable to assume that this technology was recently introduced. Similarly, in the motion “THP a world where Hillary Clinton won the US Presidential Election”, it should be clear that teams are meant to discuss the election of 2016, when she was the Democratic nominee, and not, for instance, the election of 1800, or even the election of 2012.*


### ThH Regrets [X]
Ask whether the world would have been a better place without the existence of X. 

In this debate, all teams are debating with the benefit of hindsight - the harms or benefits that teams are attributing to X have already occurred (i.e. status
quo). 
Teams must also describe how an alternative world that developed without X occurring would look like. This is also known as a “counterfactual”. 

For example, with the motion “This House Regrets the selection of Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee”, teams cannot just debate the merits or downsides of Biden as a Democratic nominee. Instead, they shouldconsider who alternative Democratic nominees might have been, and whether those nominees would have led to better or worse political outcomes than in the status quo.
