###### S&P 500
From 1957-2018, the **S&P 500** returned on average around 8% per year.
- Annual standard deviation is around 15% per annum.
- Hence, there were years when you lost -7% (1 std. deviation), -22% (2 std. deviations).
	- And there were even times when you could lose -54% (if you sold)!

Nevertheless, the high return offered by stocks makes it the most attractive long term investment vehicle.
