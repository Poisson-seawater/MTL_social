###### Active management
- Markets is not perfectly efficient
- Looking for superior investment opportunities either through fundamental analysis or statistical analysis or both.
- Aims to "beat the market" on average (abnormal excess return or alpha) 
- Professional asset management: active mutual funds (fees are usually high)
- Independent investor: makes his/her own investment choices (picks stocks).

###### Passive management
-  Markets = efficient
- Invest in a diversified financial products to replicate aggregate market returns (stock market indices) 
- Aims to obtain market performance
- Exchange-traded funds: index replication
- Relatively low management costs
