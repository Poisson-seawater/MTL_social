_**Understanding the Customer Journey:**_ Identify the initial steps a potential customer might take and target them early in their journey. For service-based businesses, establish a relationship through informative content before pitching services.

### ads - thank you page
it's best to thank people just after they make a move, like take their name after you send them a free ebook. So you can do an upsell !!
Then add another thank you page and invite them to go on your blog, and look at your article (*goal is they keep reading your information -> they get indoctrinate*)


_**Thank You Page Importance:**_ The thank you page is a crucial moment to upsell, cross-sell, or get referrals. Visitors are most receptive right after making a commitment, such as opting in or purchasing.

_**Optimizing Thank You Pages:**_ A good thank you page doesnt just say "thank you" but also guides the user on what to do next. 
- **Example:** Thank you, your guide is on the way. Check your spam folder if you don't see it. 

_**Utilizing Thank You Pages for Sales:**_ Use the thank you page to present additional offers or opportunities. 
**Example:** Want to know what we could do for you? Fill out this form for a free consultation. 

_**Setting Up Multiple Thank You Pages:**_ Create different thank you pages for different actions (e.g., opting in for a guide vs. scheduling an appointment). Follow up with an additional thank you page after they fill out the second form, keeping them engaged with your content (e.g., blog posts). 

_**Tracking and Measurement:**_ Install tracking pixels to keep track of conversions. Ensure you measure what's happening on your site to avoid wasting money on ineffective ads.


_**Using Pixels:**_ Set up a pixel to track when users opt in or make a purchase. This helps in measuring the effectiveness of your campaigns and optimizing your budget. 

_**Keeping Users Engaged:**_ Guide users to your blog or additional content to keep them engaged with your brand. Use this time to further indoctrinate them with valuable information.

### Ads - Setting Up The Pixel
_**Setting Up the Pixel:**_ Access Ads Manager via business.facebook.com. Navigate to Events Manager to set up the pixel for tracking website activities and conversions. 

_**Creating a New Data Source:**_ If you don't have a pixel set up, create a new data source. Select "Web" as the data source type and name it appropriately. Enter your website URL and follow the guided setup.

_**Connecting the Pixel with Your Website:**_ Use a website builder like Wix, WordPress, or Shopify for integration. For Wix users: Go to Settings > Marketing Integrations, and connect to Facebook. Ensure the pixel is linked correctly and test the connection to confirm its active. 

_**Testing the Pixel:**_ Utilize the Test Events tool in Facebook to verify if the pixel is tracking activities. Visit your landing page, submit the form, and check if the thank you page visit is recorded as a conversion.

_**Troubleshooting:**_ If the pixel setup doesnt work immediately, be patient and try again. Seek solutions online or ask for help in community chats. 

_**Next Steps:**_ Set up an autoresponder to handle the email addresses collected via the opt-in form. Automate sending the promised guide and follow-up emails. Upcoming tasks include creating attractive forms and pop-ups to grow your email list.



### Add Zapier and Brevo
_**Importance of the Customer List:**_ The customer list is the most valuable asset in any business. It enables repeated engagement and sales with potential and past customers. 

_**Generating Leads:**_ When people opt-in for information (e.g., an ebook or guide), they indicate interest, making them valuable leads.
**Example:** People downloading a puppy training guide are likely interested in training their puppies. 

_**Email Lists:**_ Email lists allow for ongoing communication, updates, and promotions to potential customers. Regular follow-ups with customers are crucial for maintaining engagement and driving sales.

_**Using Autoresponders:**_ Autoresponders automatically send emails to new leads, delivering promised content and nurturing relationships. They can be used to send valuable information, updates, and soft sales pitches.

_**Setting Up Brevo for Email Marketing:**_ Brevo is recommended for setting up email lists and autoresponders. Create an account on Brevo and set up a contact list (e.g., "Meta Guide Download").


_**Creating Forms and Automations:**_ Use Brevo to create lists and forms for collecting email addresses. Consider using Wix forms for better design if Brevo's forms lack visual appeal. 

_**Connecting Forms to Email Lists with Zapier:**_ Zapier automates adding contacts from a website form to your Brevo email list. Create a Zap that triggers when a form is submitted on your Wix site and adds the contact to your Brevo list.


_**Steps to Set Up Zapier:**_ Sign up for a free account on Zapier. Create a Zap with a trigger from your Wix form submission and an action to add a contact to your Brevo list. Test the Zap to ensure it works correctly.


_**Benefits of Automation:**_ Automation saves time and ensures consistent follow-up with leads. Initial setup may be technical, but it provides long-term benefits and continuous lead nurturing.


_**Next Steps:**_ Set up your Brevo account and create your email list. Connect your Wix form to Brevo via Zapier to automate the process. Prepare to create and distribute your lead magnet (e.g., Meta Guide) to new subscribers.
