In marketing, it's important to have client review and comment. To do so, timing is primordial !!!
If wait more that 14day, probability of client writing a review drop dramatically.
SO **timing** is primordial !!!


###### Starbuck exemple
Every time you make a purchase, you earn a star (and Starbucks earns a pretty penny).

This incentivizes you to keep making purchases because once you earn 25 stars, you unlock free rewards—like a free espresso shot. If you earn 50 stars, you can grab a free drink.

The asks and rewards keep growing, so **reciprocity never has a chance to decay**.


###### Leverage your buyers’ need for action ASAP

Your buyers prefer to do _something_ over nothing because **more action releases more dopamine**. It’s called [Action Bias](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/38uq46nrlxadu8665dfrh4n98pnns7/8ghlq9mkbohld7n90efk/aHR0cHM6Ly9jdXN0b21lcmNhbXAuY28vYWN0aW9uLWJpYXMv).

So *while* they’re riding the high of taking action (e.g., making a purchase, clicking “Follow,” or reading your newsletter *_wink wink_*), **ask them to take** _**another**_ **quick, easy action that will grow your business *before* they click off the page.**
