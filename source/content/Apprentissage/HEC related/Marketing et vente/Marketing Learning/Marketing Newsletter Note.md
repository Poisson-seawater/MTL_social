# info dumping
### "Stealing thunder”
is a persuasion technique where you **reveal negative information about yourself (or your company)** _**before**_ **someone else does**.

Why? Because when you admit a flaw first, you can:

- Build [credibility](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u2rml3g4uqh6kvqg0svhqlemrrrslqkel6g5708dwwq7pqppm2won04vzkg6ldxlql6oz6kvpl8qnnodd0wz3movdwx3mklw2vprpm5gmeol9rmmlm7kngp0d/7qh7h2uog4olk9h9/aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybndoeXdlYnV5LmNvbS9jcmVkaWJpbGl0eS8= "https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u2rml3g4uqh6kvqg0svhqlemrrrslqkel6g5708dwwq7pqppm2won04vzkg6ldxlql6oz6kvpl8qnnodd0wz3movdwx3mklw2vprpm5gmeol9rmmlm7kngp0d/7qh7h2uog4olk9h9/aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybndoeXdlYnV5LmNvbS9jcmVkaWJpbGl0eS8=") and trust by appearing transparent
- Control the story _and_ [reframe the weakness](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u2rml3g4uqh6kvqg0svhqlemrrrslqkel6g5708dwwq7pqppm2won04vzkg6ldxlql6oz6kvpl8qnnodd0wz3movdwx3mklw2vprpm5gmeol9rmmlm7kngp0d/owhkhwurz8r9kgaq/aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybndoeXdlYnV5LmNvbS9mcmFtaW5nLw== "https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/o8u2rml3g4uqh6kvqg0svhqlemrrrslqkel6g5708dwwq7pqppm2won04vzkg6ldxlql6oz6kvpl8qnnodd0wz3movdwx3mklw2vprpm5gmeol9rmmlm7kngp0d/owhkhwurz8r9kgaq/aHR0cHM6Ly9sZWFybndoeXdlYnV5LmNvbS9mcmFtaW5nLw==") so it benefits you

One study found that when attorneys revealed damaging information about their client or witness before the opposing side did, the negative impact was significantly reduced.

And owning the harmful information didn’t just soften the blow—the credibility boost potentially affected the verdicts.
### The Psychology of the Blemishing Effect
Mentioning a **slightly negative feature, such as limited color choice, after highlighting the** _**positive**_ **features can increase sales** compared to *only* mentioning positive features.

Researchers propose that **a minor negative accentuates the positives**, making the product or service more desirable to the buyer.

But there’s a catch.

**The person must already have a positive impression of the thing** _**before**_ **a minor negative is introduced.**

(And the keyword here is “minor.”)

That’s why the **majority of your time should be spent ensuring customers have a positive impression** of your product, service, or even brand as a whole.

That way if a slight blemish is introduced (whether intentionally or inadvertently), it’ll make you appear **more credible and trustworthy** so customers are _more_ likely to buy—not less.


Tips:
 **Make it clear who you sell to—and who you don’t**
Your product _isn’t_ for everyone—and that’s a _good_ thing.
So instead of trying to hide that fact, flaunt it.
