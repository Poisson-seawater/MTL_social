in a [[Monetary Policy]] : 
1.Expansionary monetary policy increase in MS (MS 1 to MS 2)
2. r decreaes  (r 1 to r 2)
3. because decrease in r => increse in I => increase in AD (AD 1 to AD 2) => increse in Y (Y 2)
4. Y 2 => increase in MD (MD 1 to MD 2)
5. increase in r (r 2 to r 3 this cancels in part the preceding)
6.  r increase => I decrease => AD decrease (AD 2 to AD 3 this cancels in part the preceding increase) => decrease in Y (Y 3)


Net effect:  We move from A to B in both graphs
and r decrease to r3 while AD increase to AD3 Y3.
