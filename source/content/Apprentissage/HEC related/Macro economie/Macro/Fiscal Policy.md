The government’s choices regarding the overall level of government purchases or taxes (T or G).

A governement can conduct an expansionary fiscal policy by increaseing G or a reducing T (this last one leads to an increase in disposable income and consumption). These two elements increase AD and real GDP.

An increase in G => increase the interest rate so investement spending decrease. 

When the bank of Canada chooses to fix the exchange rate, an expansionary fiscal policy will have no crowding out effects and will cause a very large increase in the demand for goods and services.


Fiscal policy has more influence under a fixed exchange rate.


Expansionary : 
When the government alters its own purchases of G&S (G), it shifts the AD curve directly.
Two macroeconomic effects determine the net shift of the AD curve:

• ![[Multiplier effect.png]] : The additional shifts in AD that result when expansionary fiscal policy increases income and thereby increases consumption and investment.
The effect on AD is increase. 
This multiplier effect arises because increases in aggregate income stimulate additional spending by consumers.

• ![[Crowding Out Effect of Investment.png]] : the offset in AD that results when expansionary fiscal policy raises the interest rate and thereby reduces investment spending. 
The crowding out effect partially offsets the effects of a fiscal expansion on AD.
