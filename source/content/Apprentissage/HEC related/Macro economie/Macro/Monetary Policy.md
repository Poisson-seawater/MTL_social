Monetary Policy take action through money supply (MS) and liquidity injection.

Monetary policy has more influence under a flexible exchange rate.

An expansionary monetary policy increases the money supply in flexible e. This results in lower interest rates: C and I increase which stimulates the level of real GDP, but leads to inflation.


The conclusion is that a monetary policy in an open economy and a fixed exchange rate regime has no effect (r = r* and ∆ DA =0). The initial ↑ MS is completely cancelled when the BoC maintains e fixed (because the intervention in the foreign exchange market to keep e fixed ↓MS).

The central bank cannot simultaneously choose the level of money supply (and r) and the value of the dollar. In a fixed exchange rate regime, the central bank does not control r. 
By choosing to change the money supply, the Bank of Canada must allow the exchange rate to vary.
