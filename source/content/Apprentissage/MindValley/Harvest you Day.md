> [!info] meditation pour dormir

As your day winds into a close, and you climb into your bed at night. Know that you are pulling into yourself. To drop down and to go to sleep.
Align your body vertically on your back and close your eyes. Sink into the softness of the bed and feel that your day is ending. 

Harvest memories for each chakra that you can pull into your inner temple and keep. We begin at the crown, the chakra of consciousness and awareness, spirituality.

###### crown chakra
What was a spiritual moment that you had today? Perhaps a moment of realization or awakening and insight. Maybe a good meditation. 
Take a moment to review that experience. Draw it into your crown chakra and like a flower folding up for the night. 
Fold up a thousand petals of the crown chakra lotus. 
And take that memory inside and let it settle. Take a breath in and experience a moment of gratitude for what you just harvested. 

And next come down to your sixth chakra, the chakra of seeing. 

###### Seeing chakra
What did you see today that was beautiful? 
Do you remember color or light? 
The smile on a child's face. 
A beautiful person walking down the street.
A landscape.
And if nothing comes to mind you can always create something in your imagination. Something of beauty to harvest into the core of your sixth hakra. 

As the two petals of that lotus close like your two eyes. And pull that memory into the deeps of. Take a breath fully in and as you let it out let that settle down into your body.

###### Throat Chakra
And next review the conversations you had today. 
Was there a moment when you felt particularly connected? Where you spoke your truth or heard someone else's truth? 
Or a moment of hearing beautiful music. 

Gather this memory into your throat chakra and fold up the 16 petals of the throat to keep that memory inside as you take a deep breath in and out. 
Letting that settle deep into your core. 

Next, bring your attention to your heart chakra in the middle of your chest. 

###### Heart Chakra
Where did you love today? 
Where did you receive love?
Where did you give love? 
Where did you do something that you love?
A moment when your heart soared.
Fold up the 12 petals of your heart chakra lotus and bring it inside to your inner temple. 
Take a breath in and let it out. 
And let that love settle in the deepest part of your being. 

###### Plexus Solar
Now, move your attention down to your third chakra in the solar plexus, the power setter.
Where did you feel powerful today? 
What was a moment when you had a lot of energy? 
When you were strong and affective? 
What did it feel like to have that power coursing through your veins? 

Fold up the 10 petals of the third chakra and bring that power into your core and let it settle.

###### Sacral chakra
And now you come down to your second chakra, the center of pleasure. 
How did you feel today?
What did you do that was pleasurable, enjoyable, fun? 
Do you remember laughing or playing? 

Or perhaps it was a touch on your skin. 
A delicious taste at a meal. 
A way your body moved. 

Harvest that feeling of pleasure into the cells of your body as you breath into your second chakra. Folding up the six petals of the second chakra lotus and letting that pleasure settle in your body for the night. 

###### Root chakra
And then finally, as you settle down into your body, to thank your body for what it went through today. 
Thank your body for doing the work that you did. 
Reviewing what touched your body. 
What did you eat? 
Where did you go? 
And feel gratitude for another day of living. 

All these experiences folding up the petals bringing it inside and letting it settle in the deep core of your being. And as your breath softens and the day drifts away, know that these treasures are yours to keep. 
As you drift off to a deep and restful sleep.
