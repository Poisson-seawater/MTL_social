## Welcome to Beyond Fasting
it's about intermitant fasting and also the connection between body and mind. 

week 1 = theory
week 2 = why and how we eat
week 3 = take control of what you eat
week 4 = thrive in edge cases

try to watch the video in the morning.

# Week 1
## Lesson 1: the 4-Stage guide to start with fasting

1.  People use intermittent fasting for a variety of benefits including weight loss, improved health, more focus and mental clarity, and developing discipline.
2.  The Kitchen Analogy 
	-   **Food on the table** - energy sources your body consumes immediately.
	-   **Food in the fridge** - glycogen reserves in your muscles and liver.
	-   **Food in the freezer** - energy that the body stores within fat cells.

There are four stages of fasting. Most benefits start to come after about 12h and peak at around 16h. So when fasting, you want to have a ‘feeding window’ of about 8 hours.

to change the rule of how your body operate. 

After 24h -> autophagy. 
crusing fasting window = 16h. 
Need to plan when we eat -> feeding window. there is 3 types: 
- late breakfast, you start to eat like around 12pm and pfit a working schedule nicely.
- early diner, start at like 7am and dinner at 3pm. concentrate meal while sun is up (digestion better).
- then there is the in-between. 

to decision: 
- family and relationship
- work
- social commitment 
- workout time -> better to have a meal before the huge workout
- sleep, feeding stop 3h before bed.

Crusing feeding window: 
- best would be start meal at 7pm and just take a smoothie. After that, workout and rice + meal then dinner with 5eggs and soup.

goal: doing a 12h fasting.
## Lesson 2: Effective Goal Setting Through the Story Vision
Did you fast for 12 hours? How was it? Today, we’ll add a level of progression to help our plane get to that cruising window, but first, we’re going to talk about Psycho-Cybernetics.

#### Key Learning Points
1.  Your Psycho-Cybernetics system is a group of _internal factors_ (such as beliefs and goals) that steer your behavior and shape your results.
2.  There are four psycho-cybernetics ‘coaches’ to help you in this Quest: 
	1.  Your Story Vision, 
	2. Hairy Goals,
	3. Reasons to Care,
	4. and Epic Stories.
3.  Your ‘Story Vision’ highlights what really matters to you and gives you a compelling future to build toward.

#### Note
exemple of the estetic chirurgien with his patient still being unhappy. 
it is Psycho-cybernetics a system that shape your mind and make you take action.

##### coach story vision
have to work on internaly vision and external factor. Have a vision for a years, that is really precise on your body. 

Step 1: Choose a future time frame for your achieving your vision

Step 2 :Tap into what’s important to you.
What comes to your mind when you ask yourself what you want your body to:
- feel like
	- effortless moving like can do any sport without having to catch my breath and feel muscle dying. 
	- that mean strenght, mobility and "souplesse"
- be able to do consistently
	- move in any kind of space, have endurance for doing sport a whole day
	- be in nature for as long as I want
- accomplish
	- swimming for 4 hours without break.
	- show strenght for long period of time
- look like
	- esthetism
	- nice arm 
	- cobra back
- and be like?
	- be my safe space
	- a machine
	- my pride

##### Step 3: Write your Story Vision.
Remember that a strong Story Vision has 5 elements:
1. Grounded - It needs to be physically possible to achieve.
2. Unreasonable - At the same time, it needs to be daring.
3. Genuine - Make sure it’s your own truth.
4. Transcendental - You can see how this vision enables you to meaningfully connect with people and expand your possibilities in life.
5. Tangible - Write it in the form of a story that tells you what your perfect day is like.

5 years form now.
I wake up, do my morning routine then go outside. I do a small jogging on the road, I go swim or climb a bit. 
Then I come back home take my girlfriend in my arm. I prepare breakfast and eat it. Then I move to work, and while I work I do some bike, walking and all my break are calisthenic figure of high level or some other exercice. While working I finish my other meal too.
At some time I just stop working and meet some friend we go climg at a boudering or a mountain, hike, surf or run ; to other  I can do all those mouvement effortlessly even with add weight. 
And we talk about strategy, business or philosophie. 
I come back home and work or study a bit more. 
Then I do some martial art training and maybe danse with my girl. 
Do my night routine and go to sleep. 



## Lesson 3: 5 Rules to Tailor Your Fasting Window to Your Goals


But first, we’ll address a few common questions about fasting itself.

### Key Learning Points

1.  The benefits of intermittent fasting come from _changing when you eat_, not what you eat. There’s no need to make changes to your regular diet.
2.  There's no special way or specific food you need to use to break your daily fast, it depends on the benefits you're going after. Consult your fasting journal for a detailed list.
3.  Hairy Goals are the next step you take toward your Story Vision, use your fasting journal to help define yours.

##### Your Actions for Today
1.  Use your fasting journal to clarify your Hairy Goal.
2.  Fast for 14h between today and tomorrow.

#### Note
no need to change your diet righ now. The benefit come from when you eat. You are just adjusting your routine of when to eat, so don't change the what you eat now.

fasting gave many benifit, depending on your goal, you can adapt:

###### goal is weight loss or fat loss
fasting will reduce your calorie intake cause you eat less (because less time to eat).
Can have: 
- water
- coffey
- the
- water infuge with legume
the 4 of them without suggar or sweet.

###### decreasing insuling level
so help the metabolism.
can add in the coffee/tea/water:
- ghee, butter, coconut oil
- bulletproof coffee
So it add a bit of calorie but it's all fat -> doesn't touch insuline.

###### Longevity
only negligible calories and abstrain from amoni acids when fasting for autophagy. 
rules :
- same as for fast loss
- but NO:
	- bone broth
	- collagen
	- CVAA or EAA supplements

###### gut rest
stricter fasting. 
- no infused water, no black coffee
- 0 calorie
- water only.

##### for all kind of fast
add a pinch of salt in water. 
if feel a bit tirred while fasting -> body saying it have electrolise imbalance.

Rules for fasting window:
- coffee and tea
- water with salt

##### coach Hairy Goal
after the vision, lets focus on the next goal.
the idea here is "how to succed the goal". 

**step 1: logical next steps for coach story vision**
train more, all the body. Move more, learn new calithenic figure.

**Step 2: Pick a milestone for the next month.**
do the pull up fighter program seriously and run once / week. 
and Learn muscle up on ring. 

## Lesson 4:  Win The Long Term Game

#### Key Learning Points
1.  Extraordinary transformation comes from changing your sense of identity at the same time you change your body.
2.  Connect your Hairy Goal to your Reasons to Care to create inner and outer goal alignment.
3.  Use your fasting journal to identify your Reasons to Care.
	-   **Why is your Story Vision personal to you?**
	-   **What's the deeper why? What are you trying to move toward?**
	-   **What happens if you don't achieve your Hairy Goals?**
	-   **What's the ‘Dark Side of the Force’? What are you trying to move away from?**

#### Your Actions for Today
1.  Use your fasting journal to identify your Reasons to Care and verify your Hairy Goal aligns.
2.  Share your reasons to care and hairy goals with the Tribe.
3.  Fast for 15 hours between today and tomorrow.

##### Note
Outer goal: change in the surface, change in routine for exemple
Inner goal: the self image. 
Outer and inner goal have to work togheter.

###### Coach Reasons to care: 
**Why is your Story Vision personal to you?**
I want to be free.
Free to move how I want and where I want. Free to walk, to run, to visit, to do any sport at any age.
Like if I want to do a marathon in the desert at 80 years; I can fucking do it. 


**What's the deeper why? What are you trying to move toward?**
I also want aestetic, I want people to say "nice".

**What happens if you don't achieve your Hairy Goals?**
I will be a depress fucker. 

**What's the ‘Dark Side of the Force’? What are you trying to move away from?**
I'm trying to move aways sadness, depression and the feeling of being entrangle. 
Also I want to show all people from the past, I'm this kind of mother fucker. Sorry, not so sorry but you (old person from my past) lost an opportunity to improve me. Hence to get here. 

**write 5 reasons**
- for my future
- for the joke
- for the quest for beauty
- for the flex
- for freedom

## Lesson 5: How to Pick Yourself Up When You Make a Fasting Mistake

##### Key Learning Points
1.  Stop assigning your future self to perfection. Play the long-term game.

-   **Give yourself an extra life and permission to make mistakes.** 
-   **You’ll see better results if you do the practice imperfectly for a long time** than intermittent fasting perfectly for a month. 
-   **Choose your challenge level each week.** Your level helps you identify your own rules and expectations.

3.  Some common mistakes people make with fasting practice:

-   **Too tight** - rigid structure becomes hard to maintain when ‘life happens.
-   **Too loose** - being too flexible with your discipline won’t get results.
-   **Compensation** - gorging on food in your feeding window can cancel out results
-   **Restriction** - eating too little is also a mistake.
-   **Expecting perfection** - give yourself some wiggle room to make mistakes.

5.  There are 4 Challenge Levels - Testing the Waters, Chill, Like A Boss, or Master.

#### Your Actions for Today
1.  Fast for the full 16 hours for the first time.
2.  Choose your challenge level and extra lives.
3.  Pay attention to what's challenging for you in this practice. Which of the common mistakes do you think may be an issue for you?

#### Note
better to do it every day and keep the same eating window. 
Circadian Rhythm prefer the same eating window.

Assign a number of extra life for the week <=> number of time you can fail. 

4 Challenge Levels - Testing the Waters, Chill, Like A Boss, or Master.
The easier to harder mode to do fasting. 

My rules
Fasting window: 14h to 16h
Frequency: Everyday
Schedule:  1h hour flexibility
Extra lives: 1 + number of shift.


## Lesson 6: The "MCII" Practice to Rapidly 5X Your Results.

And today we’re going to take a look at a scientifically proven technique that can boost self-discipline and potentially 5X your results.

#### Key Learning Points

1.  Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intention (MCII) is a powerful practice that combines positive creative visualization with the Stoic approach of _premeditatio malorum_ - preparing for the worst. Studies show it can improve results tenfold.
2.  To apply MCII, first transform your Reasons to Care into Epic Stories.
3.  Capture critical challenging moments that made you use an Extra Life before.
4.  Combine the two with help from the guided meditation and your fasting journal.
5.  Use today's meditation track to practice the visualization of all these elements in order.

#### Your Actions for Today

1.  Fast according to your chosen level.
2.  Do the written form MCII and the MCII guided meditation.
3.  Journal about your wins and lessons learned from this wee

##### Note
technique to train your discipline. Idea is VISUALISATION !! 
Close your eyes: Image you are holding a lemon, you can touch it, smell it and you squeeze it a bit and a drop go into your eyes. 
Apply this visualisation in your goal.

To make the technique more powerfull: use Stoism. Stoism medidate on worst scenario of the day and once you know what could happen, you can prepare. Hence not be touch by the obstacle, technique call:
- Mental 
- Constrating with 
- Implementation
- Intention

MCII summary
1. Vividly visualize the benefits of achieving your goal
2. Visualize what can go wrong
3. Visualize the solutions for each obstacle
	1. and rehearse the solution as much as needed

Now coach Epic Story, it's a story form of your reasons to care. 

Using MCII:
1. Writte down your Epic Stories, critical moment and implementation intentions.
2. use today's meditation track.

Also every Saturday, write in your journal:
1. Wins you had this week.
2. Lessons learned


###### Epic story
I just want to move a bit so I stand up, do a L-sit transform it to handstand push up and finish on a speudo plank.
And because it's to easy, I have to add some weight. 

When I climb, I can challenge my self to do most climbing without my foot. Just by the pure strenght of my arm. 

Last time I was at the club (martial art), I take fight after fight for 3h straight with just a couple of pause to drink water. 

###### Critical moment
I am home, tired or piss. I took my phone or open my computer. Then one think lead to another and I'm watching a serie or reading a manga. 

I don't know what to do as mouvement (or sport).

###### Implementation intentions
I am home, tired or pissed. I stop all I'm doing and I just train calisthenic figure (handstand, L-sit and speudo-plank).
I also train my muscle up on ring. 

I jsut open my Excel and do the first mouvement on the list. Even if it's the fifty time I did it today. 



## Lesson 7 = implementation day
# Week 1
## Lesson 8: Learn to Eat Like a Tibetan Monk

When I first started fasting, I had a hard time with cravings during my fasting window, until I met a Tibetan monk who taught me how and why to eat. And, today I’ll teach you.

#### Key Learning Points
1.  Changing **how** you eat brings your fasting practice to a deeper level and helps you address other eating habits. It can help control cravings and reduce the likelihood of overeating during your feeding window.
2.  Remember Bill and Ted - certain eating patterns can still lead to overeating and an unhealthy relationship with food, even if you're fasting.
3.  Try to:
	-   **Give priority to taking the time to eat.**
	-   **Eat slowly and deliberately. Enjoy your food.**
	-   **Eat undistracted unless it’s in a social setting (no TV, podcasts, etc.).**

#### Your Actions for Today

-   Keep fasting according to your level.
-   Start eating mindfully and undistracted. Sit down and be present with your meals.

#### Note
Eat with a different set of mind. Change the meal to fuel your body to a meditation. 

###### story of Bill and Ted
bill busy entrepreneur eating on the go. 
Ted freelancer, eat on the TV.
Both struggle.

Learn from Bill, his issues:
always eat standing and between meeting.
But standing and eating is a bit more stressfull for the body. And food taste less good (vestibulare system interact with the digesting system).
When eating fast, it consume more calorie.
Brain have to register the meal as a meal.

rule: eat at the table, out of the tubberware; on a plate and all. 

Learn from Ted:
routine is more flexible and eat while watching TV.
Problem you are not paying attention to your food. So brain not register the meal, so body doesn't take as much calorie as possible from this meal. 

Eat undistracting => no audio book nor podcast. Can only eat while connecting to people. 




## Lesson 9: How to Master Hunger Without Having to Push Through
Hunger can show you your true personality. Many people refuse to try fasting because they fear what would it be like to be hungry. But it doesn’t have to be that way.

In today’s lesson, you will train yourself to experience hunger using your full attention, and I share the story of the Chinese master who taught me how to master my own hunger.

#### Key Learning Points

1.  Hunger comes in waves, and with different intensities for different people. But because fasting brings regularity in eating rhythm, over time, hunger levels tend to decrease.
2.  Instead of distracting yourself from the sensation of hunger, ride the wave a few times to learn with the experience.
3.  How to Ride The Hunger Wave:

-   **What need is triggering your hunger? Physical? Emotional? Expectation? Fatigue?**
-   **What does it feel like in your body? Really focus and describe in detail to yourself the type of physical sensations you experience.**
-   **What is your mind saying? What are the tricks it’s using to convince you to stop fasting?**
-   **Ask yourself - what's the worst that can happen if I don't eat now?**
-   **Use the guided meditation below to guide you through this process**

5.  Instead of distracting yourself from the sensation of hunger, ride the wave a few times to learn with the experience.
6.  The wildest hunger waves come from stress and sleep deprivation. Stick to a sleep schedule and use the 4-7-8 Breathing Technique to help you tame sleep and stress hunger waves:

-   Inhale for 4 seconds
-   Hold for 7 Seconds
-   Exhale for 8 Seconds
-   Repeat 4 times

8.  Remember to experience hunger in your fasting window. If you’re hungry in your feeding window - eat!

##### Your Actions for Today

-   Today, fast according to your level and ride the wave at least once.

##### Note
Hunger is a teacher, it show one's true personality.
Make an experience to feel hunger with your full attention.

Hunger:
1. comes in wave
2. Only in the fasting window
3. diffrent intensity to people
4. decrease over time

take the experience of riding the wave. 
try to find whats trigger it:
- physical ? 
- expectation ?
- after exercice?

find it feel in your body, describe it?
- hole in your stomac ?

what is your mind saying?

ask your self : what is the worst that can happen if I don't eat right now -> observe your answer




## Lesson 10: Four Eating Domains to Improving Your Fasting Practice

Today, we are going to be talking about the four energy domains, what causes the drive to eat, and how it is different from hunger waves.

#### Key Learning Points
1.  The drive to eat is like a hunger wave that happens within your feeding window. This drive comes from the energetic needs of one of the four domains:
	-   Physical
	-   Mental
	-   Emotional
	-   Connection

3.  The ‘3 Check-ins’ is a technique to help you identify which of the four domains your drive to eat comes from. Try to become mindful when you notice a drive to eat and check-in with yourself three times:  
	-   **Before you eat**
		-   What’s the intensity of your drive to eat? Rate from 0-10.
		-   Which domain do you feel it’s coming from?

	-   **Halfway through your meal**
		-   What’s the intensity of your drive to eat? How has it changed? Rate from 0-10.
		-   Which domain do you feel it’s coming from now?

	-   **After you’ve finished eating**
		-   What’s the intensity now? Rate from 0 -10.
		-   Observe the mental conversation in your mind without judgment.

#### note
Looking at the "why", what part of our body need energy right now ?
Important especially if you over eat. 

## Lesson 11: What to Do If You Feel Weak While Fasting
Yesterday we spoke about needing to understand a bit more about our ‘hardware’ in the physical domain. So over the next few days, we are going to look deeper into the various needs of the body and how they fluctuate.

Today, we’ll be looking at blood sugar.

#### Key Learning Points  
1.  Low blood sugar is a common issue after high carbohydrate meals and could be a particular concern for people with metabolic diseases.
2.  A healthy body has several mechanisms to ensure blood sugar stability while fasting. Adrenaline and glucagon are the hormones associated with this process.
3.  Usually, the eventual feeling of weakness during fasting is due to electrolyte imbalances, not poor blood sugar control.
4.  Today, fast according to your level, apply the 3 check-ins process, do the riding the wave meditation, and practice mindful eating.
Remember to take note of your feeling while fasting, riding the wave, doing mindfull eating and the questionning while eating ->NOTE

##### Note
Explanation of the sugar drop. When you do grocerie, you put the fruit on the table, meat in fridge and freezer. 
Fruit on the table are the suggar we keep in our body. While the other is what we store in liver, muscle and fat.
Suggar drop is when you do a huge groceries and you store so fast the grocerie that you forget to let some fruit on the table.

###### blood sugar while fasting
there is still fruit on the table. And as the baset of fruit get empty. 
3 mecanic to replace the basket of fruit : 
1. adrenaline to increase blood suggar
2. glucagon go to liver to take some suggar.
3. glucagon + fat cells

eat more fiber to clean the fridge so better storing.

So if feel weak while fasting, take care of your electrolise level. 


## Lesson 12: Supporting Your Electrolyte Balance for Higher Energy
They're vital for health and survival. But what are Electrolytes?  

Electrolytes are minerals that carry an electrical charge. They spark cell function throughout the body, support hydration, and help the body produce energy.

#### Key Learning Points
- Electrolyte levels are about balance. The main electrolytes that can improve your fasting practice are sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
- If you're losing too much fluid while fasting, add an intake of sodium.
- Some traditionally magnesium-rich foods have become partially depleted because of modern agricultural practices. Consider supplementing with magnesium glycinate, citrate, and/or L-threonate.

##### Note
Sodium and Potassium, both need for body interaction. 

###### Sodium
Smart Sodium practices
1. be aware of the quantity of sodium in your diet.
2. Add a mineral-rich salt to your water during your fasting window
3. Remove process food.


###### high potassium food
Swiss chard 
White beans 
Salmon 
Edamame 
Pomegranate 
Watermelon 
Coconut water 
Black beans 
Butternut squash 
Clams, canned
Sweet potato 
Spinach 
Potatoes 
Beetroot 
Avocado
Tomato paste 
Dried apricots 
Banana 
Lentils 
Milk (fat-free, low-fat, whole, buttermilk) 
Artichoke 
Beef, ground

###### Magnesium
connect to more than 600 function in the body.

Magnesium is in plant.

Magnesium supplement in molecule, the most absordable are: 
- Citrate
- Glycinate or Bisglycinate
- L-threonate
- Chloride

list of magnesium rich food:
-  Pumpkin seed
-  Leafy greens
-  Almonds
-  Spinach
-  Cashews
-  Peanuts
-  Cereal, shredded wheat
-  Soymilk
-  Black beans
-  Edamame
-  Dark chocolate, 70% and above
-  Peanut butter
-  Bread, whole wheat
-  Avocado
-  Potato with skin
-  Brown rice
-  Yogurt, plain
-  Oatmeal
-  Kidney beans
-  Banana
-  Cocoa powder
-  Salmon


## Lesson 13: A Guide to Designing the Perfect Fasting Practice for Yourself
There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ when it comes to fasting, everyone is different. Today you will look back on your ‘3 Check-ins’ results and determine your dominant drive-to-eat domain.

You will also learn how to ensure that the rules you set yourself for the next weeks are compatible with your Story Vision and Hairy Goals.

Remember: there really isn’t any ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, only what makes sense to move you toward your goal.

#### Key Learning Points  

-   Your rules in this Quest should not be the same as everyone else's. Instead, they should be compatible with what your own coaches say.
-   Consult your coaches and determine the domains of eating you will respond to and the ones you're choosing not to. Then, program your behavior with the MCII meditation.

#### Note
Journal about your eating window. 

Plan by your own rules:
1. when is it ok to eat?
2. where to cross a line?
Depend on the goal.

Define clairly what it is okey.
- always answer to eating from physical need.




# Week 3
## Lesson 15: The #1 Priority of Every Nutritious Meal

Welcome back, I hope you got your groceries, because today we will learn what your Master Meal is, and the strong nutritional foundation you should build it upon.

#### Key Learning Points

1.  Your Master Meal is the one meal you prepare for yourself every day. Eventually, it will become a no-brainer, something that you enjoy, is convenient, and is nutritionally aligned with your goals.

2.  The Food Framework helps you make food choices based on your goals. Some foods are dominant in one macronutrient (protein, carbohydrates, or fats), while others are an intersection between two of them. Use this framework to ensure your meals have a strong foundation and contain at least one source of lean protein and two or three types of non-starchy vegetables.

3.  Build a Strong Foundation for your meal - use a combination of fiber-dominant and protein-dominant foods. Meals with strong foundations keep you satiated for longer and provide your body with the basic macro and micronutrients it needs: 
	-   fiber provides mechanical satiety (fills you up), 
	-   while protein provides chemical satiety.

#### Your Actions for Today

1.  Fast according to your level.
2.  Choose the meal you’re going to prepare today.
3.  Include 1 source of lean protein and 2-3 types of non-starchy vegetables.
4.  Share the meal with your Tribe.
5.  Eat this meal with reverence, celebrate it as if it was the most important meal of your day.

Our goal at the end of this week is to be able to create a meal on the go with ingredients you love, need, and which is easy to prepare - no headaches.

## Lesson 16: How to Balance Fats & Carbs

We are going to apply the Yin and Yang relationship for Carbohydrates and fats in order to serve your weight goals.

##### Key Learning Points

1.  The Yin and Yang principle helps you make food choices whether you want to increase, maintain, or decrease body weight.
2.  To increase body weight, add foods from the carbohydrate domain to your strong foundation and balance with a small amount of fat.
3.  To decrease body weight, add foods from the fat domain to your strong foundation and balance with a small amount of carbohydrates.
4.  This is not the only way to increase or decrease body weight. Rather, it's a way to structure your Master Meals to help you achieve your goals.

##### Note
Ting and yang, in the black a little bit of white and the opposite.
That mean depedanding of the goal, losing weight or gaining weight. 
For gain, go for strartchy, fruit and whole grain (yellow area). And jus add a bit of fat.
Opposite for decreasing.

L'idée des 3 cercles est que d'abord tu met dans ton assiette le Vert. Puis tu prend du jaune ou orange dépendement de ton objectifs.

## Lesson 17: The Key Habits to Fulfill Your Vitamins & Mineral Needs
The Yin and Yang Principle may be the simplest, most effective system to manage your weight, but it’s not the only way.

Today we will learn about caloric and nutrient density as another means to reach your body goals, and we’ll also learn some interesting sources of micronutrients, otherwise known as vitamins and minerals.

#### Key Learning Points

If Yin and Yang don't match your preferred type of diet, you can achieve your results with the opposite pattern if you apply the concept of caloric density to your meals.

1.  Caloric Density
	- **To decrease weight on a carbohydrate-dominant diet,** focus on carbs with low caloric density.
	- **To increase the weight on a fat-dominant diet,** consume more food with high caloric density (like nuts).
2.  Micronutrients
	- If protein, carbs, and fat are the body’s gasoline, then micronutrients are the air in the tires, oil in the engine, and water in the radiator. They keep it running smoothly. 
	- To gain the right amount of vitamins and minerals:
		-   **Rotate your non-starchy vegetables,**
		-   **Consume fatty fish every 3rd day**
		-   **Consume organ meats - the real animal superfoods - every 3rd day**

_Tip: Use the Cronometer app to check the micronutrient level of your meals_

##### Note
every 3 days, have organ meats (liver, heart) and fatty fish.


## Lesson 18: Removing "Red Lights" From Your Feeding Window

So today we’re going to focus on identifying and removing ‘Red Lights’.

#### Key Learning Points
1.  ‘Red Light foods are dense in calories, empty in nutrients, and usually, cause inflammation in your body. They don't belong in Master Meals.

2.  Most of the highly processed foods are Red Lights. Warning signs on labels include any variation of sugar, processed oils, or more than 400mg of sodium per serving.

3.  Now you know how to prepare a Level 4 Master Meal, try different variations until you find several options that nurture your body goals, are highly enjoyable, and convenient to prepare.



In general, you can identify red light foods if they contain any of these things in their labels:
- Sugar, maltodextrin, dextrose, and other forms of sugar in the first 3 ingredients.
- Trans fat or hydrogenated oil.
- Canola, rapeseed, sunflower, soybean, and other processed oils.
- More than 400mg of sodium per serving.

## Lesson 21: Pause

## Lesson 22:  Food for Fun
*“One bite done the right way is equivalent to one hundred unconscious ones.”*

1. The purpose of ‘food for nutrition’ is to provide nutrients without harmful ingredients.
2. The purpose of ‘food for fun’ is to have a pleasurable experience, regardless of nutritional value or presence of harmful ingredients.

If want to have food for fun, can have them to fullfil their goal -> having fun and enjoyable experience.

Can have food for fun AFTER having real food.

It's a question of Expercience, just like Tantra chocolate exercice for Anticipation. 
Ask yourself if the experience was worth it. Compare with average fun food and best fun food. 



## Lesson 23: Eat Out Like a Champion
*“This is about lifestyle. You won’t get far if you avoid eating out forever. Rather, become a champion of this practice.”*

1. When eating out or ordering in you can still find options that are delicious, affordable and match your goals. These are called Champion Meals.
2. **Find a few options for Champion Meals** from different restaurants and food delivery services. That way, you will always eat resourcefully, even when you are not preparing your own meals.

#### Key Learning Point
 goal is to create a list of Champion Meals in a number of restaurants and delivery services.
This is what they should be like:
1. One big serving of lean protein.
	- Grilled, broiled, boiled, or baked.
1. Two to three servings of vegetables.
	- High-fiber, low-sugar.
	- Baked, boiled, or grilled.
1. Carbohydrates and/or fats according to your rules.
	- High-quality fats from avocados, eggs, coconut oil, olive oil, etc.
	- Carbohydrates with a medium glycemic index.
1. No red lights.
2. Delicious and affordable.


###### Table of high and low-quality fat sources 
so you can know what belongs to your Champion Meals.

High-quality fats| Common sources of trans
fats|  Processed oils
--|--|--
avocado | baked goods (pastries, cookies, doughnuts, muffins,
cakes, pizza dough) | canola oil
cold-pressed oils (extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil) | fried foods (French fries, fried chicken, chicken nuggets,
breaded fish)| corn oil
dark chocolate | margarine | palm oil
fatty fish (salmon, sardines, anchovies, trout, mackerel, herring) | packaged snack foods

peanut butter and almond butter | vegetable shortening sunflower oil
seeds (chia, sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, flax) |

###### Glycemic Index
The carbohydrate sources of Champion Meals are those that slowly increase blood glucose
levels when digested.
In other words, they have low or medium glycemic index.
A GI score of less than 55 is considered to be a low. 
A score between 55 and 70 is medium and
higher than 70 is considered high.

Bear in mind that the glycemic index of a meal can be different than a food in isolation due to the
mix of ingredients and portion size.
Also, the GI is not accurate and so use this list more as a guideline than a hard rule.

2. Identify where the protein and veggies are, but also where the foods you don't want are.
3. Get your plate and serve yourself food for nutrition.
