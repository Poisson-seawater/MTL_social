Main priority is the movement. How I do the movement. 
Think into plain of movement. 
There is 6 movement. 
– the Big 6 – that, when combined, will target the **musculature of the whole body**.

1.  Choose one exercise per movement that is challenging for you but that you can execute properly. You will have a list with six exercises, one per each type of movement.
2.  Do a workout with these 6 exercises by executing them very slowly until you reach muscular failure or 2 minutes per exercise, whatever comes first.
3.  Take notes of how much time you managed to do each exercise. This data will be crucial to help you decide how to progress on your training the next time this week we do this routine
