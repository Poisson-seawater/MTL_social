### On Stress Reduction
Stress can be positive or negative which means it can actually be managed. 
Reducing the things that cause you undue stress is essential to improve your lifestyle and indeed your health:
Forms of modern stress include those 3: 
- Toleration : 
	- Toleration can sometimes be seen as a virtue however when it comes to things that you are tolerating and are draining your energy it becomes a form of stress.
- Worry:
	- Sometimes what we are really worried about os that we are going to forget to worry about it.
	- Making a list of the things you are worried about can help you to orient your mind to think about solutions and awareness plus relieving your subconscious mind from worries.
- Anxiety
	- Our biochemistry assimilates undue anxiety and creates chemicals that generate feelings like fear or stress inside us.
	- Focusing on the things that are working really well and doing powerful breathing exercises will drastically change your response to events.




### Sugar Free Me?
1. There are two main sources of energy our bodies use: sugar and fat.
2. Sugar consumption results in spikes in your energy supply, which can cause hormonal and emotional ups and downs;
	- as sugar consumption influences hormones related to our emotional states. 


Sugar plays a role in our health and nutrition however we need to be aware of the side effects of excessive sugar consumption.

Sugar also stimulates appetite, that is why today something like 60% to 70% of the food you buy in a grocery store in a package has some form of sugar in it.

### Lifestyle detox

from: 
- Caffeine, Nicotine and Alcohol
- Processed food 
- The Environment 
	- Living in a clean place with good fresh air and that is absent of things like excessive dust, dust mites and molds, can be an incredible step in making sure that your immunity is operating optimally.



### Breathing
Breathing is one of the ways we communicate with our body. 
- Shallow breathing could be a defense mechanism responding to an event where we feel in danger as it is a stress inducing behavior. 
	- If we just focus on shallow breathing our body may produce excessive cortisol and adrenaline which starts suppressing our immune function and reducing our levels of empathy.
- On the other hand, when we do deep diaphragmatic breathing we communicate with our cells that our environments must be safe which is incredibly good for our mental and physical health.


The **5-5-5 breathing technique** is a framework that can help you along your days to feel
grounded, safe and stress-free any time.
- Breathe in for a count of 5
- Hold your breath at the top for a count of 5.
- Breath out for a count of 5.
- Hold your breath at the bottom for a count of 5.

### Water
1. Keep an eye on the quality of the water you are drinking. If possible, drink mineral water that comes from natural resources.
2. Drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day, spreading them out at different times.
3. Drink water proactively so you keep yourself hydrated days in advance.
4. Try to drink water 15 min before your meals.

### Sleep
Whenour body and mind goes into a state of repair (sleep) 
Having a proper "waking up" and "going to sleep" routine, will influence the number of days that you start waking up naturally to the point where you may no longer need to use alarms.

The number of days you get to wake up naturally will highly influence your wellness and success.

##### Ultimate Sleep Environment
- A source of cool fresh air.
- Make your environment really dark.
- A clean, organise room and comfortable bed.
- Turn off all electronic lights.
- notepad beside the bed


### Sunlight
- Stimulates really good Vitamin D production.
- Makes it easier for your body to produce Melatonin
- Makes you sleep better & feel better.

> get a healthy level of sun on as many days as possible


### Flexibility
1. Lymph is the fluid that travels around your body and cleanses you.
2. Moving your muscles and stretching helps to move the lymphatic fluid around your body.
3. Improving your flexibility can help reduce aging of your body and it positively influences your immune system.

### Connection
1. Our need for connection is incredibly important and supports our overall physical and mental health.
2. When we spend time with people, really great things happen to our nervous system and immune function.
3. Oxytocin, the love chemical, is incredibly beneficial for supporting your immune system.
4. Acts of giving and receiving generate oxytocin within us, those who we help, and those who witness an act of help.
5. Ask yourself the following questions for people you may want to help:
	- What do these people need?
	- How can I help them?
	- What can I do to give back?
6. When you receive affection and physical touch you:
	- Reduce cortisol levels
	- Reduce stress chemicals in your body
	- Increase oxytocin
	- Support greater happiness
	- Support greater immune function
	- Support your health


### Carbohydrate
focus on slow carbohydrates from:
1. Root vegetables.
2. Occasional fruit.
3. A little bit of honey from time to time.

### Fat
1. Fat is one of the most important and healthy things we need in our diet.
2. A good rule of thumb is to take a look at using the types of fats that have been in human consumption for the longest.
3. Some examples of healthy fats are animal fats (if you are not vegan), coconut oil and olive oil.


### Vitamine
1. There are 13 essential vitamins that you need to get to keep your immune system strong.
2. Getting those vitamins from natural foods, grown in the most natural form possible, has an immense impact on your immune system capacity.


### Minerals
some of the most important functions of minerals:
- Regulate blood pressure
- Regulate fluid control through the body
- Influence the immune system
- Help us to make new cells
- They control electrolyte balance

### Amino Acid
There are 20 amino acids that we require and we manufacture 11 of them. 
Amino acids are the building materials that we need to build proteins and indeed body muscle.

2. We can get amino acids from animal and plant sources.
3. Lysine is an amino acid incredibly important in the process of creating antibodies.

## Seasonal eating
GOAL is to mimic the environment that our DNA evolved in; otherwise known as seasonal eating. 


How Does Seasonal Eating Work?
We live in a world where we experience many different temperature and weather changes, therefore leading to different availability of food throughout the calendar year.

As seasons constantly fluctuate, humans have evolved into developing certain characteristics that mimic the ability to go periods of time without food, store certain nutrients, and learn to store calories. 
- To a degree, we want to mimic the environment that humans have evolved in to allow the body to run its full range of potential. 
	- *Living as hunter-gatherers in Africa, there would be times that there would be an abundance of fruit, and then have periods where there were none. This also goes with bitter green vegetables, berries, and more.* 
- Nature decided what was available to eat and when based on the abundance of raw food that was available.


However, today we have an abundance of everything right at our fingertips - which can be great with enhancing our ability to eat meat, berries. 


When it comes to choosing foods that will strengthen your immune system, it is critical to be aware of what we eat and how much, as it can have an impact on how our immune system responds. 

For example, let’s take a look at the vegetable Kale:
- Kale has many great nutrients in it, including calcium, fiber, and more. 
- However, when you eat kale on a regular basis, your body starts struggling to uptake magnesium, which causes a magnesium deficiency. 
- As a result, the effects of a magnesium deficiency include damaging your sleep and causing things like muscle cramps. 
- Therefore, it’s best to eat Kale occasionally so that you can still get the nutrients, but avoid the bad effects that accumulate.


### Spring:
Spring is ideal for resetting metabolic health, cleansing, and weight loss.
This communicates to the body that “Winter is over” and that there is no further need for creating or maintaining stores of energy and water (fat).

When simulating Spring, you should focus on eating high-quality vegetables, bitter green vegetables, high-quality lean protein (fish, meat, shellfish, poultry), increasing your water intake, and eliminating sweet foods/sugar or carbohydrate-rich foods.

### Summer:
Summer is a season of abundance marked by the addition or increase of root vegetables and occasional berries.  
In this season, we suggest a reduction of animal protein and an increase in root vegetables, with occasional consumption of berries. 
- This is an excellent season for strength training and exercise.

##### Fruit
- Apples 
- Grapefruit
- Pomegranate
- Apricot
- Kiwi

### Fall
Fall is a season of high abundance and energy storage, focusing on the increased availability of root veggies and fruit. 
In this season, we focus more on the consumption of fresh fruit. 
- Ideally, as part of a mono-meal and on an empty stomach, the fresh fruit is full of plant-based protein, vitamins, minerals, water, and healthy sugars.

For people looking for a break from meat or animal protein, this is an excellent vegan season.


### Winter
This is a season of cleansing through fasting.

This is the season that our body prepares for all year, and particularly, in the Summer and Fall.
- Winters can produce times of food and water shortage. 
- While Winter may seem like a good season for weight loss, it is not. 
	- It tells the body that food is scarce, and to be reluctant about releasing fat stores. Low calorie diets stress the body and make it worry about starving to death. This may cause weight gain, slowed weight loss, and general lethargy or feelings of depression.

The redeeming feature of Winter is that it does give the digestive system a break. Digestion is a major drain of resources, and fasts can be an excellent way to cleanse the body and digestive system.


###### 3 general type of fasting
Water Fast
