### Get Familiar With Your Anatomy 
The part you see on the surface is only telling a fraction of the story. 
- Similar to an iceberg, only a portion of the penis and clitoris is seen above the surface.
- The penis and the clitoris are extremely sensitive, and touching them the right way is highly linked to having an orgasm.
- The prostate gland can be found between the rectum and the scrotum, also known as the male G-spot.

### What Makes Sex ‘Good’?
Understanding how your body works leads toward optimizing your biology. 
1. The biggest and most important sexual organ is your brain, where desire and sexual responses begin. 
2. The feel-good hormones produced during sex are 
	1. dopamine,
	2. endorphins,
	3. oxytocin, and
	4. serotonin.
3. The sexual response cycle consists of four phases: 
	- Arousal or excitement 
	- Plateau 
	- Orgasm 
	- Resolution period

![[Sexual Response Cycle.png]]
During begining of the plateau, play with clitoris.
Resolution period give feeling of warm, well being and intimacy.

For girls, resolution and readyness to start again can as short as couple of second.

### Why You Can’t Orgasm 
Why do heterosexual women orgasm much less than men? 
1. Men reliably orgasm 95% of the time during sex, while heterosexual women only reliably orgasm 65% of the time during partnered sex.
2. Although vaginal orgasms can feel different from clitoral orgasms, they both rely on activating a part of the clitoris. 
3. Ultimately, great sex comes down to understanding your anatomy, figuring out what you like, and then communicating that to your partner.

why the gap?
especially when clitoris have more nerf than penis. 
G-spot myth come from Freud. Woman usually need vagina and clitoris to orgasm.

- Cocamidopropyl betaine 
- Parabens 
- Poloxamer 407 
- Formaldehyde

You can add 1 tsp of xylitol to sweeten if you prefer. Combine the above ingredients and use as needed to freshen breath and help maintain the proper pH of the mouth.

2. The main reasons for declining hormones are age, unhealthy lifestyle, stress, and lack of sleep. 
3. Men's testosterone levels have been declining rapidly in recent decades due to the high estrogen levels.

4. Cut out high-sugar foods.



#### Endoctrine Disruptors to avoid

- **Dioxins** — produced as a byproduct in herbicide production and paper bleaching, they are also released into the environment during waste burning and wildfires
- **Perchlorate** — a by-product of aerospace, weapon, and pharmaceutical industries found in drinking water and fireworks 
- **Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS**) — used widely in industrial applications, such as firefighting foams and non-stick pan, paper, and textile coatings 
- **Phthalates** — used to make plastics more flexible, they are also found in some food packaging, cosmetics, children’s toys, and medical devices 
- **Phytoestrogen**s — naturally occurring substances in plants that have hormone-like activity, such as genistein and daidzein that are in soy products, like tofu or soy milk 
- **Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)** — used to make flame retardants for household products such as furniture foam and carpets 
- **Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)** — used to make electrical equipment like transformers, and in hydraulic fluids, heat transfer fluids, lubricants, and plasticizers 
- **Triclosan** — may be found in some anti-microbial and personal care products, like liquid body wash

### Support the Structures
Stronger pelvic floor muscles can lead to increased arousal. 
1. Pelvis muscles play an essential role in sexual function and pleasure in men and women.
2. Well-placed Kegels during sex can heighten pleasure and sensation for both partners. 
3. Kegels and Anti-Kegels can improve pelvic health, but those with a hypertonic pelvic floor should avoid Kegels


#### Anti-Kegel and Kegel technique
1. empty bladder 
2. Close your eye when lying dowm and focus on imagining your bowl (ton bassin)
3. 5 Bs
	1. Breath 
		1. slowly through the nose
	2. Belly 
		1. relax it, so belly push-out when inspire
	3. Back
		1. relax
	4. Buttocks

For Anti-Kegel:
1. Relax the muscle
2. during sex, make orgasm last longer and deeper.
	- prolong arousal

For Kegel: Contraction the muscle
1. 5 breath and contract 
2. hold for 10s
3. relax complety for 10s
4. set of 10, around 5 set / day, throughout the day
	1. can do it during other gym exercice
	2. can do it during rest between gym exercice


Rentrer le ventre ou over exercice of Abdo can lead to hyper-contract or Tight Kegel muscle. 


##### KEGEL QUIZ

1. Do you have pain during or after sex? 
2. Do you have persistent or recurring pain in your pelvis, tail bone, lower back, abdomen or hips? 
3. Do you have frequent constipation, straining with bowel movements or difficulty emptying your bowels? 
4. Do you have difficulty or pain with inserting a tampon (for vagina-owners)? 
5. Do you have problems emptying your bladder completely, pain with urination, slow urine stream or the need to urinate frequently?

If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you may have a TIGHT (hypertonic) pelvic floor and should see a pelvic floor therapist before attempting Kegels. Anti-Kegels are very safe and can be a good tool in which to begin relaxing the pelvic floor.

#### Sexual Response Curve Questionnaire
**Answer the following questions about your most recent sexual experience:**

A. Once touching/foreplay was initiated, how QUICKLY did you become maximally aroused?
-  Scale of 1-10 with
	- 1 being “Arousal was extremely slow” and
	- 10 being “I got aroused extremely fast” 

1. How long did you stay in the aroused state before either having an orgasm or ceasing activity? 
	-  Fill in the blank: (ex: 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 30 minutes) 

2. Did you have an orgasm? If so, how many orgasms did you have? 
	-  Y/N then fill in the blank … (ex: Y, 3 orgasms)  

3. How STRONG/Pleasurable was your orgasm(s), if applicable? 
	- Scale of 1-10 with 
		- 1 being “No orgasm or not pleasurable” and 
		- 10 being “It was extremely strong and/or mind-blowingly pleasurable” 

4. After orgasm or cesation of sexual activity, how long was it until you would have been physically ready to have sex again? 
	- Fill in the blank: Ex: 5 min, 2 hours, 2 days 
	
5How to use the questions above to make an Arousal Curve: 
1. This is a sloped line that comes up from the X axis. 
	1. The slope of the line will be calculated based on the number given.
	2. The higher the number given, the faster the rise of the slope. 
	3. The height of this curve will be fixed so that only the slope is variable. 
2. How long the plateau phase (peak arousal phase) lasts will depend on this number. We’ll need to have a range of something like 1 minute to 120 minutes as the possible lengths of this phase. 
	1. Then, we’d just plot the number given along the X axis within an allotted number of possibilities 
		1. *ex: if the arousal length on the graph can be up to 12 blocks on the X axis, an answer of 120 would take up all 12 blocks whereas an answer of 60 min would only take up 6 blocks.*
3. IF there is **no orgasm**, THEN the curve does not peak beyond the height of the arousal phase. 
	2. IF there is an **orgasm**,  THEN there is a resultant upward blip on the curve. 
	3. IF there were **several orgasms**, THEN each one is its own blip. 
4. How strong the orgasm was will determine how high the orgasm blip is. This should overall be a fairly small vertical distance compared to the arousal phase. 
	1. *For example: Maybe it’s only possible to go up 3 blocks on the orgasm*. 
5. The length of the refractory period will be how long the person stayed back at baseline. For ease of calculation, the slope of the refractory period curve will be constant for everyone.
