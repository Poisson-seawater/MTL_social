Chemistry is not the key to succeed long term love. Attachment phase, which come after the deeply in love feeling (1 to 3 years), need to share value, purpose and destiny.

Quality for good relationship:
- Self respect
- Healthy boundary 
- Having difficult conversation 
- Admitting true feeling !! 
- Honoring our needs 
- Negotiate for your need

Create more clarity: *for example, before sex clarify what it mean. Ask her how she want to be treat after the sex. Ask her what she is looking in the long term*.

Generative Inquiry questions (good question):
- Are open-ended
- Invite reflection
- Help cultivate creative curiosity
- Move you towards new possibilitie
- Can be felt in the body

Long term love require a high degree of generosity. Generosity is about granting space to be imperfect.
SO
- Give up having to be understand and saving first. 
- And embrace apologize first.
- Give up punishing someone.

###### Lesson from [day 20] - Acceptance
When you finally have the courage to accept and love the totality of who you are, you open up to the possibility that someone else can do the same for you, and you for them.

Opposite of love is idealisation. Learn to embrace and love imperfection (her and yours).

Be that new person you want to be from the future. Start living as him right now.
