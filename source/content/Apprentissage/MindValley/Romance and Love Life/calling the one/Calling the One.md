[[calling the one - journal]]

### Setting intentions
#### Step 1 - Why Are You Here?
- I decided to start this Quest because:
- This is important to me because: (Include what or who this could benefit.)

#### Step 2 - Who Am I?
It is important to start with knowing what you wish to get out of the experience. Intentions help to
create more clarity, especially when the seed is planted right before you start.
- By the end of this Quest, I am:
- 3 core values associated with this identity are:

#### Step 3 - Self-supporting Beliefs
> ‘’Whether you believe you can, or believe you can’t, you’re right.’’ -Henry Ford

Once you have your intentions clear and you know who you want to become, consider the beliefs that align with those intentions. Beliefs are the ultimate cornerstone of success. Think of the beliefs that your highest self would have about themselves and their abilities, and adopt them.

- Write down 3 to 5 empowering statements about yourself, and make them as simple and clear as possible. Make sure they are in the present tense, positive, emotionally meaningful, and in the first person (I, me, my ).

*Examples: I am poised and ready for more good than I can ever imagine. It is easy to live my life full of bliss, abundance, and ease.*



### Réflexion (day 2)
Meditation from the course

### Bold intention for love (day 3)
- Write down your intention and memorize it.

### Navigate (day 4)

### Release resentments (day 10 and 11)
- “Who do I still resent and for what?”
- “Where do I feel the anger and hurt towards this person in my body?”
- “What specifically did I do or not do that contributed to what happened?”
- “What has this cost me?” *(Notice the consequences of turning away from the truth. All of these ways that you contributed to what happened. Notice what it cost you and others.)*
- What can I now let go of as it relates to this person or this situation?

> idea of those question is to get rid of the negative feeling (like blame) from past experience.

### Witness your inner experience with Love (31)
Exercice : Throughout the day, practice staying present and connected to your own inner experience by naming your feelings and needs

List of vocabulary: [[Word to use - Feeling - Eng]].


### Self-soothing Practice (day 32)
**Preparation for Self-soothing Practice:**
To prepare for this practice, I invite you to think of a time recently where you were feeling off-center, insecure, maybe even overtly upset about something someone else did or did not do that was disappointing and/or hurtful to you. When you have that in mind, I want to invite you to notice where you may have felt the feelings of that upset in your body.


**Prelude to Self-soothing Practice:**
To begin with, close your eyes and take a deep breath, anchoring into the deeper, wiser center of your Adult Self that has access to wisdom, power, resources, and resilience. 
Do you notice the emotional center of the Younger Self? Where is he/she in your body? How old are they?

Extend deep presence from your Adult Self to the Younger Self, surrounding them in a field of support and care.

Ask the Younger Self, “Sweetheart, what are you feeling?” and mirror back what they tell
you they are feeling. Ask, “Sweetheart, what do you need?” and mirror back what they say they need, whether or not you can provide that for them at this moment.

**Self-observation/self-inquiry:**
Notice and try to name the beliefs and assumptions that the Younger Self is thinking from. What are they assuming is true? What beliefs are coloring their perceptions?

Begin to challenge and question the beliefs and assumptions they are inside of. Push back against the certainty of the Younger Self with a compassionate ferocity that will not allow them to be dominated by that which is not actually the deeper truth.

**Self-soothing Dialogue:**
Begin to share with the Younger Self what is more true about the experience she is
having. Ask yourself, “How might I explain another perspective/correct a misperception to
a [____] year old that I loved?”

Offer and assert another perspective that is more anchored in truth in a loving, kind, yet firm way. Reassure them, offering encouragement and containment. Access a perspective that is trusting in the process of life.

Create a self-soothing mantra (e.g., “I love you honey. You’re safe with me. This is just vulnerability. Vulnerability is very normal.”)



### Owning yourself as the cause (day 38)
After something that leave a bitter taste in the mouth, after blaming someone. Try to answer those questions:

- “Who am I making wrong and for what?”
- “What old belief about others may be coloring my perception of what's happening between us?”
- “What else might be true or what might be even more true than this old belief?”
- “In seeing this clearly, what is my part in this situation?”
- “How could I begin showing up in ways that might foster well-being in this situation?”
- “What could I accept about this situation that would help me to give up blaming and shaming anyone?”
- “What can I appreciate about this situation?”

### Great Question (day 39)
Generative Inquiry questions:
	- Are open-ended
	- Invite reflection
	- Help cultivate creative curiosity
	- Move you towards new possibilitie
	- Can be felt in the body

### be present when Listening (day 40)
Listen is love with action.

Attention is the currency of love. Goal is to practice presence, to engage at the soul and heart level.

1.  Go beyond seeking transactional attention. 
	- go deeper and be more available to truly connect with people.
2. slowing down and be curious about people without any agenda,  ->will creat more authentic connections

 Meditate on this question: 
 > “What is going on within me when I am listening to others?”
 
 
**Task:** Once / day. 
Have at least one conversation where you consciously choose to slow down and give your undivided attention.

Listen to people, listen with empathy, experience the exchange, slow down.


### Improve Yourself  - Speak up (day 41)
Question to ask to yourself
1. What’s upsetting me that I’ve not yet expressed to the person I’m upset with?
	- What is this costing me and/or our relationship?
	- How might I share this upset and in a way that could allow our connection to deepen?
2. What vulnerabilities have I been withholding, and from who?
	- What is this costing me and/or our relationship?
	- How might I share my vulnerabilities more authentically and in a way that could allow our connection to deepen?
3. What complaints have I been making lately about someone who matters to me?
	- What is this costing me and/or our relationship?
	- What request could I make of this person instead and in a way that could allow our connection to deepen?
4. Where have I been failing to ask for what I want and need from another?
	- What is this costing me and/or our relationship?
	- How might I share my feelings, wants, and needs in a way that could allow our love to deepen and grow?

### Cultivate Faith (day 43)
Throughout the day, meditate on what it feel like, smell like, taste like to have my love in my life. Enchor this sense of worthiness in my life

### Generating love (day 44)
Write a list of four to five qualities that really define love for you.

When a situations in your life irritate you, write it down

Choose one of the situations above and then ask, “What would Love do now?”

### Forgive Yourself and Other (day 46)

1. Write a list of one to three people that you feel angry with or resentful toward, and you can put on it why, and you can even include yourself on this list.
2. Choose one person from your list above and answer the following questions.
	1. “What boundary violation/loss did I suffer that is causing me to feel angry?”
	2. “How might I have allowed or even colluded with their bad behavior?” *(if it was someone else who violated my boundaries)*
	3. “*If it was myself,* what choices did I make that violated my own sense of personal safety, and what motivated me to make this choice?”
	4. “What action does my anger want me to take to restore balance, well-being, and integrity to this situation?”
	5. “What amends will I now commit to making, moving forward?”
3. “Who am I ready to forgive, and for what?”


When anger happen, you want to hold it in the deeper part of you and ask yourself :

1. What need to change ?
2. How have I been giving aways my power ?
3. What right do I need to reclaim ?
4. What boundary do I need to set?
5. What amend need to be made to myself?

> Anger is a sign there is some work to do

## week 2
### 8. Trust the breakdowns
> “I am an excellent life-long learner. Each time I make a mistake, I learn even more about how I can have happier, healthier, and more fulfilling relationships.”

Destruction is the first step of creation. Use them to improve. 

### 9.Asking More Beautiful Questions
> “I open myself up to the many ways I can now grow myself, capable of manifesting the miracle of happy, healthy love.”

> “I now choose to apply all of the hard won lessons learned in this eelationship. And I promise to show up with greater levels of self-respect and self-love from this moment forward.”

Blame and shame kill the possibility for grow. Give up blame and shame. This is an ego trick to avoid shame.
Be 100% responsable for the past. 

==Good relationship require:==
- Self respect
- Healthy boundary 
- Having difficult conversation 
- Admitting true feeling !! 
- Honoring our needs 
- Negotiate for your need

Those must be respect.

### 12. Evolve toxic Relationships
> “I stand fully in my power in all of my relationships and service to manifesting a mutually empowering, happy, healthy partnership.”

Note: 
Relationship where you are afraid to sometime, they do a character assassination if you refuse to do what they want, they try to hold you hostage. And you try to do all that you can to avoid triggering that person. Relationship with fear, obligation, and guilt. It is the concept of fog.

The issues is that those people may be people we can’t throw away from our life. The problem is how toxic we become in relationship with them.

Let go of the survivor strategy and show up as power, strong, healthy, center version of me. Now challenge and increase the wellbeing between you and others.

Keep in mind the other person will likely stay the same, and not change.

The plan is to work and improve us, not them. So, to not do explode and say how we felt cause being reactive = giving power away. We want to stop giving power away and stay in the center of our power to elevate the quality of our connection. And become the leader of greater level of health between me and that person. That mean, speaking the trust about how I feel and how I need in any given situation + start setting boundaries that are appropriate to the connection.

Remember my only fidelity is to the future I am standing for. Not to the relationship.

To prepare for a shift in a Relationship:
- Send love to the part of my self that is scare
- Remind my self that I don’t need approval
- Share how much the relationship means to me
- Take responsibility for diming my self down
- Say what is going to change between you, and say what is going to happen (boundary and always saying your trust)


### 13. Renegotiate old agreements
> “I am now willing to clear away the old and welcome in the new to align myself fully with the having of deep happiness and health in love.”

Old agreements are often unconscious, outdated loyalties that need closure. In order to free your energy from the old agreements:
- Become consciously aware of them.
- Make new agreements that are aligned with the future you are creating.

Find a way to complete your old agreements, either face-to-face, on the phone, or in a meditative soul-to-soul connection.


Relationship are determine by a series of packs and promises that are sometime spoken out loud. Or assume or implied.

Agreement are usually about loyalty and expectation and they exercise a strong pull over decision.

Old agreement = outdated loyalties


### 14. Treat yourself the way you want to be treated
> “I give myself the love and respect I would love to get from others.”

1. It’s likely that the way you treat yourself as an adult is reflective of how you were treated by the people who raised you.
2. If you want your patterns in intimate relationships to change, make a conscious choice to begin treating yourself in the ways that you want others to treat you.

Treat yourself first, and treat yourself the best treatment. More importantly, how do I respond to myself, how do I talk to my self, fulfil my dream.
-> law of Karma, get what you do (treat you good -> receive good)


## week 3
### 15 Connect the dots
> “I have the power to grow myself into the person I will need to be to manifest and sustain happy, healthy love.”

Take a look at your belief in love and create a new one. A new relationship with love.
To access to the power to change an issue, we need to access and challenge the belief behind them.
Who I am in that future fulfill with the perfect love.


### 16 Name Your False Love Identity Beliefs
> “Not everything I think or feel about myself in my life is true. I am so much more than this. And in seeing these beliefs clearly, I awaken to the truth of my power and my worthiness to love and be loved.”

Name the stories and beliefs that have been coloring your perceptions of yourself and influencing the actions you've been taking and the choices you've been making in your relationships.

### 17 Wake up to your True Love Identity
> “I choose to wake up to the power I possess to create happy, healthy love. And I step into the truth of my worthiness to receive this love into my life and into my power to create it.”

Goal is to be ready for the new story of love. 
So first, forgive yourself and the others. 

### 18 Embrace a growth mindset
> “I have the power to evolve how I show up in all of my relationships to generate a healthier, happier, more fulfilling love life. I take this on now. I am worthy of this love.”

goal: breaking the inner glass ceiling of our potential in love and courageously exploring the new ways of showing up that anchor us into the true love identity.

Mentor yourself to learn from your experience.

Find your old belief and create new one (belief and behavior).

With the people aroud you: ==Create more clarity==. *For example, before sex clarify what it mean. Ask her how she want to be treat after the sex. Ask her what she is looking in the long term … .*

### 19 Shifting centers
> “I will not spend one more moment living a lie. I claim the truth of my worthiness to love and be loved, and I stand in the truth of my power to create the miracle of happiness in love.”


Change happen throughout habit and time. And disapointment show us what to change in us. 


### 20 Reclaim your disowned self
> “I own all of who I am, recognizing all parts of me as deeply deserving of love.”

1. Love happens when it's safe to fall short in the presence of another.
2. When you finally have the courage to accept and love the totality of who you are, you open up to the possibility that someone else can do the same for you, and you for them.

Be that new person you want to be from the future. Start living as him right now. You want someone that take care of your blind spot, love yourself on your good and bad day.

Opposite of love is idealisation, the fantasy of finding someone perfect. Love happens when it’s safe to fall short in the presence of another. It is our vulnerability that make us lovable, all the part of us that are subjugate underground. When we meet someone who we sense has the quality we have been disowning, we do 2 things : we start judging or idealize them.

Sometime it is not that we want that person, as they want to be that person as we want to reclaim that part of ourselves that have does quality/skills (certaine fois, on veux un personne plus pour ses qualités que l’on veut ramener a nous. Exemple de la fille qui date des musiciens jusqu’a qu’elle se remet au piano).

Remember, in the history of mankind they will never be someone like you. So accept and love all of you and stop trying to edit out whole part of your humanity. It open you for someone else to do the same and you to do the same. It is wholehearted love (unlimited growth and potential).

Miracle happen through us more than to us: get out of your comfort zones and take risks.

Having faith means staying true to yourself and paying attention to the signs and the synchronicities around you.

Throughout the day, meditate on what it feel like, smell like, taste like to have my love in my life. Enchor this sense of worthiness in my life. And ask my self,
- what I need to let go in order to find my way in that future ?
- how I need to grow my self now ?

1. True forgiveness is an emotional expansion of the heart, and it can be arrived at once you have transformed your anger.

2. Anger is a force of transformation. The healthy response to rage is to point it in the direction of positive change because anger needs to move.

3. Once you have found a purpose for your anger, you will more easily be free to forgive yourself and others.

### 47 Expand from Me to We
> “I am a strong, solid me, and I am happily preparing myself to co-create a strong, solid we with my beloved-to-be.”

### 48 Become Unstoppable

Plan to navigate between the challenge to come.

1. When you make a big commitment, expect a breakdown of everything that is not aligned with it.
2. Make empowered meanings from your disappointments. View mistakes as growth opportunities.

The problem is not the problem, the problem is our relationship to the problem. Meaning look for growth opportunities in every issues.

Remember, destruction then creation, for every growth there is a destruction of an old pattern before.

When feeling a problem, think about my power statement and the growth opportunities + meditation of where is located my pain ? sending love there. Asking my self how old I was, listening to what feeling I had. Then sending love and remembering what is incredible being my age. Then thinking about growth opportunities and power statement.

Power statement : life is offering me opportunities to growth and achieve my goals.

### 49 Hold the High, Watch for Love
