# Setting intention
###### written 2023-04-07
- I decided to start this Quest because:
I want to fall in Love, to have a romantic partner to have fun, dream, live life, make love, discovert the world, share thought ... and grow/improve with.

- This is important to me because: (Include what or who this could benefit.)
It is important to me, because it will motivate me to create a better world. To leave a legacy behind for the new generation. 
It is important to me because it will allow me to grow faster and stronger.

- By the end of this Quest, I am:
Ready to meet the One, take care of her and start making the world better, one business at a time. 
Ready to fall in love and take deep care about our relationship.

- 3 core values associated with this identity are:
I like to debate, explore thought;
mantra: The true meaning of life is to plant _trees_, under whose shade you do not expect to sit.” – Nelson Henderson
I'm looking for freedom, of action, of mouvement (however with commitment to one person). 

- 3 to 5 empowering statements about yourself, 
I am ready for success in love and business.
I am easy to live, calm and councious.
I am ready to plant tree that I may not see there shadow.
I'm ready to live my life with abundance.
It is easy for me to get the best out of everyone.


# Réflexion (day 2)
###### written 2023-04-08
- “What is your emotional interpretation of this?”
I get rid of jugement, rid of emotion of what is outside of my control. 

- “How old is this part of you?”
It's the new me, I accept the past as it is and I now focus on the futur. Cause "Whaterver happen, happens".

- “What choices have you been making, what actions have you been taking that almost set others up to play out the pattern?”
Maybe I am isoleting myself, I rarely open to other person, I struggle to take other people feeling into consideration vs  chossing the logic.
Maybe I reject people incousciously.
