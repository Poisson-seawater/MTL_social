- 5 mains touch
1. spreading: start with belly and ribs + featherlight touch -> to spread energy
2. circling: still featherlight touch (remember, the less touch the more anticipation), circle the whole breast -> smaller circles to get close from nipple (but not touching them -> tease, build anticipation).
	- Circle = mouvement fond 2 oval avec centre breast et nombril.
	- les 2 ovals forme un coeur.

3. tracing: featherlike touch, around the top and the signs of the nipples until they become arousal and erect. 
	- spread the energy to the whole breast, belly and even neck
	 - can go back to square one to get nipple erect. 
4. pinching: when nipple erect. Start pinchin towadr the root of the nipple; and play with harder and less hard pinching.
	- when pinching nipple, you create automatic squeezing of vaginal canal.
	- stay on the "brown area" of the breast for that pinching for the trick (but go outside for the anticipation/teasing)
5. Rolling; after pinching nipple, at the root of the nipple start to roll your finger around the nipple
