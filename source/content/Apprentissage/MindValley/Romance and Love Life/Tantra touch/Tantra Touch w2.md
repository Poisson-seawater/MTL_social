Knowing what you want is a prerequisite of attaining it. This week you will have a chance to set your intentions for the Tantra Touch Quest, so you can start working towards better intimacy, better relationships, and mind-blowing soulful sex.

Isadora explains the advantages of having a healthy sex life and the effects of stress, and how pleasure can become an addiction.

The main topics covered are:
-   Why is orgasm necessary
-   The benefits of sex
-   What are the everyday stresses
-   The mechanism of pleasure addictions

###### Note
Orgasm -> neuroplasticity
sex can be use as a form of meditation, to live longer, to go beyond your ego, confidence.
Plus orgasm is anti-stress.
Pleasure addiction of Gabriel: manga, netflix, instagram. 
Source of stress of Gabriel : futur?
When live under stress hormone, we want to release the opposite of stress hormone (dopamine, serotanine and pleasure hormone). -> that's how you start addiction
> nothing is good or bad, everythink is about quantity

carefull cause sex can be an addiction, especially is lack on connection. 

My intention from this quest: to give a better sex and more deep-bounding connection with my partner.

## Lesson 8: The Top 4 Roadblocks to Orgasm
The main topics covered:
-   Top 4 roadblocks to orgasm
-   Different kinds of shame for men and women
-   The effects of shame on mind and body
-   Science of shame and Neurological study by Dr. Komisaruk
-   Bonobo apes vs. chimpanzees in regards to conflict resolution
-   From Left brain to Right brain

###### Your Actions for Today
1.  The next time you are having sex, try the Left Brain to Right Brain Exercise to be present and connected more to your body and your partner.
2.  Reflect on how stress affects your body. How can you recognize it, and what can you do to release it?

###### Note
First Roadblock is stress, people are in a state of flight or fright like in primal time. And it release cortisol. When stress, the body stop digestion + tighter jaw, intestin and ass. Plus body take everythink as a treat. 
So important, to get a pause and get the stress out + more happy hormone.
For that, use a tantra meditation.
One simple breath exercice is while breathing, trying to expand the stomac. 

Also, be more present. Think about all the outside stimulation and set a time to shut down all the outside stimulation. So less multitasking and more attention to intimacy + focus on her body and enjoy it more.

2nd roadblocks: lack of sexual literacy. Need to demestify sex. Live in society where no body tell you and teach you sex, like woman nobody tell them how their body work. Which give lack of knowledge.

3rd roadbloc: numbness. and
4th roadblock: shame.
Shame make us unable to feel what is hapening in your body. And shame in the membrane impact your brain -> your biggest organ for orgasm
Bodyshame, like fear of nudity. 
Shame of desire of pleasure. Repress make you compress and then explode your emotion.
Case study, bonobo resolve conflit by sexuality when chimpanze resolve it by violance. 
Case study on woman who said never experience orgasm. They put woman on IRM, while sexually arousing them. After the experience those woman said they didn't orgasm, however on the scan the brain activity show orgasm and increase of blood flow into the genital. 2 sign of orgasm. So the orgasm have been numb by the psychologie. The question is why?
*Note: left brain give jugement so this is where to start.*
One exercice, se caresser le bras avec sa main, comme une plume qui passe. Et laisser that tingling senstation and goosebump se propager dans tout le corps. The idea is to stop any jugement and thought and just appreciate and have 

Most of the problem with woman in sex is mental. Rarly physical. 

In sex, stop analysing and in life too, be present. 

*Litterature pour argument: female orgasmic disorders link to stress (Shadbolt, 2009)*
