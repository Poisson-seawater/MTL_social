###### Orgasmic triggers and exercises for women
orgasm triggers: clitoris and breat.
3 ways of self pleasure
1. tease your self -> breast massage who release oxytocin
2. clitoris massage -> the more tease in clitoris -> the more dopamine when orgasm
3. Jade egg or milking practice -> learn relax or contract [[K|kegel]] exercice
###### Four types of orgasms for women
Best to explore is to do one after the other, but alway keeping a stimulation on the clitoris. 
1. clitoris orgasm
	- learn to deep more deeply -> last longer
2. internal orgasm
	- play with the lips first -> wait for increase blood flow
	- deep breath
	- then go for the cervix -> and activate [[K|kegel]] muscle
3. G-spot orgasm
	- finger into a C shape
	- massage it first
4. Wet orgasm
	- may feel like their are going to pee
	- can feel paintfull at first

Orgasm is all muscle contracting then release, can go close to all contraction. Then get back at square one => nipple arousing and start again. 

###### Whole-body orgasms and multiple orgasms
every orgasm is like a wave from the infinite ocean (sexual energy). 
and take time to let the wave impact yout and give you all it energy. 
- always deep breath

##### Tantric breast massage
nipple stimulation release oxytocin -> can make someone fall in love with you with just that.
oxytocin also release in breast feading and sex.
Plus breat stimulation activate same neuron as vaginal orgasm.

###### breast massage:
- let the energy go all aroung the body. 
- 5 mains touch
1. spreading: start with belly and ribs + featherlight touch -> to spread energy
2. circling: still featherlight touch (remember, the less touch the more anticipation), circle the whole breast -> smaller circles to get close from nipple (but not touching them -> tease, build anticipation).
	- Circle = mouvement fond 2 oval avec centre breast et nombril.
	- les 2 ovals forme un coeur. 
	- quand rapprochement, oval -> real circle on the breast.
3. tracing: featherlike touch, around the top and the signs of the nipples until they become arousal and erect. 
	- spread the energy to the whole breast, belly and even neck
	 - can go back to square one to get nipple erect. 
4. pinching: when nipple erect. Start pinchin towadr the root of the nipple; and play with harder and less hard pinching.
	- when pinching nipple, you create automatic squeezing of vaginal canal.
	- stay on the "brown area" of the breast for that pinching for the trick (but go outside for the anticipation/teasing)
5. Rolling; after pinching nipple, at the root of the nipple start to roll your finger around the nipple
	- feel the surge of oxytocin in the whole body
	- play with pressure

#### Prostate massage

moving especially leg/glute/harmstring important for testosterone.
