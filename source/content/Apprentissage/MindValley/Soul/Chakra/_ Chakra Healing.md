# Fundamental of the Chakras
List of word to help adress feeling and emotion more precisly: [[Word to use - Social Connection -  Eng]].


The chakra system is both a philosophical system and an energetic system that originated within the yoga tradition of India. Since ancient times, the chakra system has been seen as a ladder for liberation as a series of stepping stones to higher consciousness.

**Chakra**![[Chakra At Glance.png]]Chakras are wheel-like organizational centers for the reception, assimilation, storage and expression of life force energy.
- *like all chakra = a house, and each chakra one of the room of that house*
- Chakra = metaphore for the Architecture of the Soul

Chakra are to help you in your meditation. 

Each chakra gas core programs that govern what you do, feel and think. They are the in-between / gates external and internal word.

Goal is to **free** from Pattern, to become more FREE.


#### How do Chakra Energy Work?
> Sushumna, Ida, and Pingala

Sushumna is the central meridian, a super highway of where energy channels from cosmic intelligence and earth energy.

Some texts show Ida and Pingala crossing between the chakras, while other show them crossing at the chakras. Others describe the currents ending, or beginning, at the left and right nostril.

# Suite
## Fundamentals of the Downward Manifesting Current
1. Through passing each other, the upward and downward energetic currents create vortexes that are the chakras.
2. The downward current begins in pure consciousness and descends through the chakras, becoming denser with each step from thoughts to solid reality.

## The Global Heart
1. The world is at a time of both planetary crisis and technological advancement where change is not only possible, but direly needed.
2. Society is undergoing a transformative process similar to the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. We can all play a conscious role in the evolution.
3. The rise of the Heart-Powered Evolutionary is a movement of people who stand in power, for the power of love.


### Opening Meditation & Setting Intention
1. Your vision is the vehicle that helps you fulfill your life purpose.
2. Often, the most traumatic experiences are the ones that mold us for our service.

## [[Crown Chakra  Chakra Healing#Upward Consciousness Creates|Manifesting Crown Chakra: Consciousness Creates]]
1. In the downward current, we work with 3 aspects of creation: to be, to do and to have.
2. Remember to reach far with your goals. Reach far. Stretch and pull your reality forward.
3. Whenever you decide to create something new in your life, or declare a new intention or belief, this act automatically stimulates all previous and conflicting intentions and beliefs from the past to re-assert themselves. Crosscurrents can appear as anything that shows up in response to your declaration – other than what you intended.
4. Exaggeration gets stuck energy out and allows the freed up energy to go to our intention.

## [[Third Eye Chakra  Chakra Healing#Upward Vision Vitalyzes|Manifesting Third Eye Chakra: Vision Vitalyzes]]
1. Beliefs are made from consciousness. Our crown interprets and makes meaning out of experiences. Those meanings accumulate to create beliefs in our third eye.
2. If we are repeating a pattern, it is because a belief is operating underneath the surface.
3. How we perceive and see affects our ability to manifest. What are the belief programmings blocking your third-eye chakra?


## [[Throat Chakra Chakra Healing#Upward Communication Catalyzes|Manifesting Throat Chakra]]
Communication Catalyzes
1. In the throat chakra, we move from pure being into the realm of doing, into the social world.
2. Through communication, our consciousnesses can meet the social world.
3. What often stops us from sharing is the communication we have with ourselves. 
	- You first have to get out of your own way.

## [[Heart Chakra Healing#Upward Love Launches|Manifesting Heart Chakra: Love Launches]]
1. Manifestation moves faster when we start doing from a place of service.
2. When committed individuals gather their energies, build a web of relationships, and apply the structures necessary to get things done, nothing can stop us.

## [[Solar Plexus Chakra Healing#Upward Power Produces|Manifesting Solar Plexus: Power Produce]]
1. Realize that everything you do is because you are choosing to do it. Everything.
2. To follow through with your plan, you have to be determined to reach it. That means dealing with all the obstacles that might be in your way.
3. Five common obstacles are:
	- A. Shoulding on Yourself
	- Distractomania
	- Otherizing 
	- Don’t-have-itis
	- Tomorrow-crastination

## [[Sacral Chakra Chakra Healing#Upward Pleasure Pleases|Manifesting Sacral Chakra: Pleasure Pleases]]
1. In any dream, there are things you want and things you need. Both are important, but the needs are necessities.
2. Unmet needs will sabotage because your wants will take over in unhealthy ways.
3. Identifying the difference between wants and needs is the first step. Asking to get your needs met is the second. Often, it means expressing what we don’t want or need.

## [[Root Chakra Chakra Healing#Upward Matter Matters|Manifesting Root Chakra: Matter Matters]]
1. This is the point of manifesting when your ideas have fully birthed and have been witnessed by others.
2. Even with success, we often self-sabotage – not believing we are worthy of having our successes. One of the most common root chakra issues being money.
3. It first starts with believing our capacity to HAVE, then only can we receive.
