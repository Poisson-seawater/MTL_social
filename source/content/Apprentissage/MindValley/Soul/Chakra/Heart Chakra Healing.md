# Heart Chakra
## Healing the Psyche
1. Programming of the heart chakra happens in between the ages 3 to 7 years old 
	1. when a child learns to behave in ways to get love. Personas are then formed often at odds with our authentic selves, which can later lead to a lack of true intimacy in adulthood with others and ourselves.
2. Programmed blockages can be caused by grief stemming from abandonment, rejection, loss, conditional love, or any form of child abuse.
3. The internalized relationship with our parents later shape the relationship patterns with others and ourselves.
4. Compensations are made to heal past wounds often resulting in closing up for protection or becoming overly clingy. Internalization of parental expectations shape self-criticisms, which later affects patterns in adult relationships.
5. To heal our psyche, we must first learn to love and accept ourselves. It starts with having a healthy ecology of the heart; all aspects of ourselves are integrated and loved.

**Developmental Stage**: 3 to 7 years
**Developmental Task**: Socialization, acceptance

Programming at this stage of life happens when a child learns what to do, how to act, and who to be in order to get love and acceptance from others. As such, they learn to reject and disown aspects of themselves which are not deemed “acceptable”.

These rejected aspects of the self form a person’s “shadow” – unconscious aspects of a person they have learned to disown. This is a loss of wholeness.  Movement towards self-love and self-acceptance comes from learning to love and bring into light those aspects from the shadow into wholeness.

Grief is a natural response to loss, not only in the connection with another, but also with yourself. One must reconnect to one’s self to overcome grief. The aim here is to give yourself what you lost.

**Chakra Challenge**: Work through grief
**Chakra Gift**: A light heart full of love

## Healing the Spirit
1. The world paradigm from a hierarchy of power is shifting from a “power over others” to a “power with others”.
2. The awakening of the global heart is a movement from a chain of command to a web of connection.
3. Caring is a key ingredient to improving ourselves and the world around us.


Spirit and world, the heart chakra in the world is beginning to shape a new organizing principle of the world – elevating our own selves from ego to eco, chain of command to web of connection, greed to green, self to service.

How do you play a role in bringing more heart into the world?

# Upward: Love Launches
To be of value is also to be able to offer value. Remember this: we have value, to offer value.

Start thinking about how does your dream serve others?

The technology for manifesting through the chakras can be used for individual dreams, but if that’s all we do, we create a collective nightmare.

We can end the nightmare by creating a collective dream, but only by communicating, collaborating, and cooperating with others. The synergy of ideas that occurs in this process creates far more than the sum of its parts.

We want to move beyond the ego and into the realm of “what is the possibility you stand for in your dream?”

Say in your statement: “I stand for the possibility of…”

In that place of possibility, it’s no longer about just you – it’s beyond the ego. And often that you’re not going at it alone.
