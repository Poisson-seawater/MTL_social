**Basic Info**: The seventh chakra is also known as the crown.
**Location**: Cerebral cortex.
**Element**: Consciousness, thought.
**Name**: Sahasrara, means “Thousand Fold”.

Like a king whose crown signifies order in the kingdom, the crown chakra represents the ruling principle of life—the place where the underlying order and meaning of things is ultimately perceived.

It is the receiver of the unified field of consciousness that is the source, yet also embraces the mind that thinks, reasons, and gives form to our experience.

Here we cultivate the awareness that re-veals our true essence as divine consciousness.

**Key Words**: Transcendence, immanence, higher power, divinity, union, vision, thousand petaled lotus, consciousness, unity, wisdom.

**Exercice**: Practice being in your witness. 
Stop and ask: 
- Who am I right now? 
- Who’s in here? 
- Simply observe, calmly from center of lotus.

Developing the witness consciousness means to open awareness to seeing many things we ordinarily miss. Simply observe your own thoughts, the surrounding situation and any other details with as neutrally as possible.

Refrain from judgment, criticism, attachment, aversion, or clinging to any particular viewpoint.

Simply observe, like a detective, taking in every detail. Notice who it is that is observing.

**Challenge**: Meditate for 10 minutes a day for the
rest of the week.


**Chakra Triumph**: Awareness of body, awareness of awareness, witness consciousness, releasing attachment, and being fully present.

## Affirmations:
- I am awake and aware.
- The world is my teacher.
- I am guided by higher intelligence.
- I am guided by inner wisdom.
- Divinity resides within.
- All is one.


# Crown Chakra
## Healing the Psyche
1. The crown chakra is the chakra of consciousness itself, the invisible essence that is behind everything.
2. By letting go of attachments, one frees up their consciousness and attention.
3. The crown chakra’s gift is liberation. It involves the power of Kundalini – a highly concentrated charge, a powerful healing force.

**Developmental Stage**: Early adulthood and after
**Developmental Task**: Assimilate knowledge; to have awareness

Is there a higher power? Can I trust it? Your parents provide the first experience of higher power, and if you can’t trust your parents, then you can’t trust the chakra closes to higher power in general.

**Chakra Challenge**: Attachment
**Chakra Gift**: Liberation

### What is Kundalini?
Kundalini is highly condensed and concentrated charge or prana, like a hot poker that pushes through knots in bamboo, Kundalini pushes through blocks.
It is a healing force, but is not always easy to handle.

### How does Kundalini awaken?
Awakening Kundalini is not always a pleasant experience many people have extreme difficulty functioning in their mundane lives while Kundalini is
unveiling illusions. 

People can fall into depression or fear. It’s important for those who experience spontaneous awakening to have a spiritual teacher to guide them.

It can awaken by initiation from a training guru, years of yoga or meditation practice. Some people on and off the spiritual path spontaneously experience spiritual emergence, increased charge. 

Kundalini is an unique and powerful experience which can result in a profound consciousness change; it is ultimately healing.

**Kundalini symptoms**: charge of energy, shaking, trembling, spontaneous movements (kriyas) increased alertness, sudden insight, visions, voices, a feeling of transcendent bliss and weightlessness.

Ask yourself: What can I do to release these attachments?

## Expanding Awareness
1. The crown chakra is more about consciousness than the body. Practice expanding your awareness.


## Healing the Spirit
1. Evolution is god's way of making more gods.
2. Faulty worldviews and paradigms that are associated with blocked chakras:
	- There isn’t something beyond.
	- That we are not part of divinity
	- That we don’t know anything, knowledge but no wisdom.
3. There is divinity in everything.
4. Miracles happen when we notice the divinity in all things and treat them as sacred.

**Spirit and World** – becoming a divine human means to integrate both transcendent and immanent paths.

As we have evolved, we have become more sophisticated, powerful, and intelligent. Therefore, evolution can be seen as the gods’ way of creating more gods. Whether we individually are godlike depends on our consciousness that enables us to hold these powers with wisdom.



# Upward: Consciousness Creates
Your body is the prism that breaks down consciousness into its seven vibratory levels the way a prism breaks down light. 
This is a logical step-by-step process that we follow every day as we live and express ourselves. Each step downward makes an idea denser and more specific, bringing it closer to manifestation.

These same steps can be cultivated to manifest our dreams. Manifestation begins in the realm of consciousness, through ideas and information.

### What are Crosscurrents?
Here’s a little-known but very important law of manifestation:

Whenever you decide to create something new in your life or declare a new intention or belief, this act automatically stimulates all previous and conflicting intentions and beliefs from the past to re-assert themselves.
These are called **crosscurrents**.

Crosscurrents can appear as anything that shows up in response to your declaration – other than what you intended. Imagine your intention is an arrow that you want to have hit your target; the crosscurrents are like the wind that blows crossways to your arrow and sends it off-course.

Today’s exercise will be about discharging the energy around those crosscurrent thoughts because they're occupying energy. By exaggerating, meaning getting it out rather than in, we free up energy to go towards our intention instead.
