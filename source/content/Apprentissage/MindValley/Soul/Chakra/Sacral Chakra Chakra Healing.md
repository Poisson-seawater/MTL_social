**Basic Info**: Second chakra, often called the Sacral Chakra
**Location**: Second chakra is located in the abdomen, between the navel and hip crease. It includes the lower back, the pelvis and the sexual organs.
**Element**: Water
**Name**: Svadhisthana, means “one’s own place.”

Once we have energy coming into the body, the next step is to move it through the body, reflecting the fluid nature of this chakra. 

The second chakra’s purpose is to feel, to move energy, and to increase your capacity for pleasure. 

Feeling is an important aspect of consciousness, which carries important information from the body to the brain.

**Key Words**: Sensation, feeling, emotion, pleasure, flow, movement, sensuality, sexuality, enjoyment. 

## Chakra exercice: Feel the charge of your emotions.
When you feel an emotion come up, feel the sensation of it. 
- Take your attention off of the story that caused the emotion 
	- and keep your focus on the sensation of emotional charge instead. 
- Feel where it is in your body, 
	- and what it wants to do. 
- See if you can allow your body to relax, 
	- so that it can release the emotion, 
	- yet keep the charge
	- and harvest it into your tissues.

## Chakra Challenge: To enjoy and feel pleasure.
Schedule something pleasurable and really take the time to savor it. Could be going out to dinner, a hot bath with candles, or a sexy date night.

- I deserve pleasure.

# Sacral Chakra
## Healing the Psyche
1. **Developmental Stage**: 6 months to 2 years old
2. **Developmental Task**: Sensate exploration of the world (pleasure/pain); gain emotional literacy; establish emotional connection
3. Programmed blockages can be caused by denial of the child's feeling state, unpleasant or painful environments, or unbalanced emotional environments.
4. Guilt can hinder the natural flow of emotions and desire in our adult life. When we overcome guilt, we allow ourselves to enjoy and feel our emotions more fully.
5. To heal our psyche, we must first learn how to embrace our emotions, feel them, and allow ourselves to feel sensations without guilt.

This chakra comes into play once movement is possible for the child. 
- The child is moving into the world, exploring through the senses.
- Learns what is pleasurable or painful, good or bad. 
- Communicates only through emotion, because it does not have adequate language yet. 
- Movement, sensation, emotion, all get wound up together. 

IF life was painful, movement and feeling are restricted.
- THEN Guilt can ensue for feeling or wanting anything. Guilt stops our flow, blocking impulses from completing and needs from being met.

**Chakra Challenge**: Overcome guilt and numbness
**Chakra Gift**: Pleasure, enjoyment


## Healing the Body
1. Bio-Energetic Movements
	- Charging: Butterfly Legs
	- Discharging: Pelvic Pulses
2. Everyday Movements
	- Bioenergetic Swing
	- Wave motion

### Butterfly Legs 
From supta baddha konasana (soles of feet together, knees out, like a butterfly), Exhale as you slowly bring knees together, Inhale as you spread knees apart. Repeat slowly at first, then experiment with different speeds (charging).

### Pelvic Pulses
Rapid rocking back and forth of the pelvis while lying supine. Can be followed with lifting the hips 2 3 inches and holding. This will get pelvis moving spontaneously (trauma releasing exercise, discharging).

Extra bonus with partners: 
Resisted bridge pose: Helper puts hands on outer hip bone to create resistance, while recipient moves into bridge pose (charging).

### Bioenergetic swing
Inhale, move hips and tailbone backward, exhale, and swing them forward.

### Wave motion
Inhale, take tailbone back, exhale, swing it forward, and as you do, follow wave all the way up the body. Gets the body loose and fluid. Moves energy up the spine.



## Healing the Spirit
1. There's power in sharing and having our feelings witnessed and understood. It helps us build deeper connections and compassion.
2. Feeling our sensations, guilt, and our sexuality are all related in our sacral chakra.
3. Learning to balance ourselves means not only to express our emotions, but also learning how to contain them as well.
4. Healing in the sacral chakra starts with letting go of judgment of ourselves and others and feeling compassion.

When we denigrate feeling, we numb. Without feeling, there is no compassion. 
A world that makes touch into a bad thing is a world out of touch. People out of touch with themselves, become out of touch with each other and out of touch with the planet.

There's power in sharing and having our feelings witnessed and understood. It helps us build deeper, more meaningful connections.

Practice working with your feelings, get comfortable with sharing them and recognize we all have a common thread. This will help you get more in touch with your sacral chakra and realize we all feel guilty; we all feel, period. There are no such things as “bad emotions”. It’s just learning to handle the charge, which is our basic aliveness.

# Upward: Pleasure Pleases
Here’s where it starts to come together, the tributaries of the streams flow into a river that begins to have its own momentum.

In any dream, there are things you want and things you need. Both are important, but the needs are necessities.

Most of us were taught as children – either by family or friends – that it’s bad to be needy. As a result, we fail to acknowledge things we do need. If don’t acknowledge our needs as necessities, we don’t give them the priority that is necessary. If we feel guilty about having them, it’s more difficult to get them met. Unmet, they remain as unfulfilled needs stopping our progress. 

Identifying the difference between wants and needs is the first step. Asking to get your needs met is the second.


But mere asking might not be enough. To get what we want and need, we must be able to express our needs in a way that brings results, exactly the way we want them.

Now, even if we ask, we don’t always get what we want. It’s important to remember that as we ask, we are surrendering to what we receive as well. Your friend may not what to reschedule, and instead of getting upset, let go of the expectation that others should conform to your needs and wants.

## Exercice
List your need in order to fulfill your dream. Then list what you want.
