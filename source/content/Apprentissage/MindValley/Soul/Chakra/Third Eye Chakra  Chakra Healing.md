**Basic Info:** The sixth chakra, often called the third eye chakra, rules over intuition, imagination, and visualization.
**Location**: Forehead, brow.
**Element**: Light.
**Name**: Ajna, means the ability to perceive and command.

The sixth chakra is about seeing in the deepest sense of the word. To have insight, to remember, to pierce the veils of illusion and see the truth.

Seeing a big part of realization: to see with “‘real eyes.” That is the third eye, center of intuition, imagination, and vision.

**Key Words**: Light, illumination, vision, intuition, clarity, imagination, remembering, dreaming.

**Exercice**: Choose to see the positive. We have a habit of seeing the negative instead of the positive, which is not the whole picture. Choose to see the truth which is whole.

**Challenge**: To pierce through illusion and see beauty. Beautify something in your surroundings.

# Third Eye Chakra
## Healing the Psyche
1. Programming of the third eye chakra happens during adolescence. When an individual learns to think independently and make sense of themselves and the world.
2. Programmed blockages can be caused by visual trauma, leading to repression and dissociation from memories, or invalidation where we learn to invalidate ourselves as adults.
3. Consequences of third eye blockages can lead to illusions such as self-scrutiny, “shoulds”, always seeing what’s wrong, and perfect images.
4. Healing the third eye chakra has less concern with past childhood trauma and is better developed through the practice of seeing yourself and others.

**Developmental Stage**: Adolescence
**Developmental Task**: Establishment of personal identity

This is a time when the individual is forming their identity and making sense of who they are in the grand scheme of things. In this process, they are forming their own world and personal views.

**Chakra Challenge**: To pierce through illusion
**Chakra Gift**: To see with clarity




## Healing the Body
1. Bio-Energetic Movements
	- 6th Chakra Breathing (Charging)
	- Blowing Pictures (Discharging)
2. Everyday Movements
	- Yogic Eye Exercises
	- Forehead Pull

**Body & Health**: The third eye relates to the pineal gland, a light sensitive organ. The body needs both light and darkness. When we are deprived of light, we are missing an important “vitamin” for our well-being.

When we don’t have regularity in our sleeping – at least 8 hours of darkness and rest, melatonin is thrown off, and can negatively affect our immune system, our physical and psychological well-being, and our ability to dream.


### Sixth Chakra Breathing (Charging)
Imagine you are at a window with curtains in front of you and you want to spread those curtains wide open. Start with your hands on your eyes. Inhale with your nose and open your eyes wide while extending your arms outward, opening the curtain. 
Exhale with your mouth and cover your eyes again. Repeat several times rapidly.

### Blowing Pictures (Discharging)
Close your eyes and allow an image to come to mind. Then, imagine a rose or some kind of container to put the image in. Imagine your third eye sending a laser beam to blast the image. Blow up the rose or the container.

### Yogic Eye Exercises
Move your eyeballs and look in every direction, and then clockwise and counter clockwise.


### Forehead Pull
Breathe and pull the forehead with your fingers. Stretch it outward as if stretching open the third eye.


## Healing the Spirit
1. Humanity is at a time when we can envision and create a better future, but the illusion of separation hinders the process of evolutionary creation.
2. Seeing is an act of creation. By choosing to see possibilities, you can create possibilities in real form.
3. Your world is a reflection of your consciousness. To see it clearly, become still


Creating and seeing a world of beauty. Beauty as underrated spiritual value. Beauty means we’re close to the divine. Seeing from place of witness, neutral observer, like a camera. Noticing and savoring the intrinsic beauty in everything. The interconnectedness of everything. Seeing the big picture, through time and space, perspective from cosmology.


### Exercice
1. Practice coming into stillness with yourself.
2. Bring your awareness to your third eye.
3. Take a perspective outside yourself.
4. Fuller engagement: Try looking at the whole Earth.

# Upward: Vision Vitalyzes
Today, we move from declaring to the realm of vision and intuition, the third eye chakra. Envisioning what we want.

Start with seeing the point of fulfillment. Now, did you believe you can have it? 
Often, there are beliefs blocking your ability to reach what you see. You need to do some belief clearing to make beliefs that support your vision.

Today’s exercise will help you to:
1) Identify old beliefs that you adopted in the past.
2) Examine them for their relevance and value to your life today.
3) Make a conscious decision to keep each belief or let it go.
4) Dissolve the ones that don’t serve you.
5) Create new beliefs that will work better for your life.
