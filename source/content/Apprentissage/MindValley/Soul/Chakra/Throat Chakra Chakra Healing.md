# Throat Chakra
## Healing the Psyche
1. Programming of the throat chakra happens in between the ages 7 to 10 years old when a child to interact with others.
2. Programmed blockages can be caused by lies stemming from mixed messages, secrets and neglect.
3. The internalization of invalidation and not being heard manifests in later adulthood as not knowing and expressing our own truth.
4. To heal our psyche, we must reclaim our voice – our right to speak and be heard.

**Developmental Stage**: In between the ages 7 to 10 years old
**Developmental Task**: Learning to communicate and socialize. 

Once a child becomes socialized and feels accepted by those around him, he enters the fifth chakra stage of learning and expansion through various forms of communication. 
Here, the child who has made it through the previous developmental stages intact, feels free to express himself, ask questions, share his internal truths, and dares to be creative.

But when things impact a child that he can’t speak about, the fifth chakra becomes compromised.

**Chakra Challenge**: Pierce through lies
**Chakra Gift**: Creativity


### Exercice
Reflect and write down:
- Where in your life are not speaking your truth?
- What are you afraid of in speaking it? How might you have learned this fear?
- What is your need? (to be respected, listened to, not judged)
- How can you request a listening that honors your concern?


## Healing the Body
1. Bio-Energetic Movements
	- Shoulder Shrugs (Charging)
	- Get off my Back (Discharging)
2. Everyday Movements
	- Neck Rolls
	- Jaw Stretches

**Body & Health**: This chakra relates to the shoulders, neck, throat, tongue, and mouth. 
Practice opening the throat and shoulders, chanting, and vibrating sound.


### Shoulder Shrugs (Charging)
Rapidly lift and lower shoulders, inhaling as you lift and exhaling as you lower your shoulders.


### Get off my Back (Discharging)
At should height, curl your arms to form a wing on both sides. Start to elbow behind you with the left and right elbow and then both elbows while saying, “get off my back!”

1. Neck Rolls
Do this several times a day, especially if sitting at a computer, after a long
drive, or holding a book or computer in your lap. Simply roll your head around
very slowly in a circle, pausing at tight places in your neck.

### Jaw Press
Great for a tight jaw. Place the heel of your hand underneath your jaw with
mouth closed. Apply resistance with your hand while trying to open your jaw.
If you’re in a place where you can safely make sound, let out some sounds
while stretching your jaw open.

## Healing the Spirit
1. Not speaking our truths, allows the status quo to continue remaining unchecked. We were taught to be “good” by staying silent.
2. Throughout history, creatives and the artists were the social architects, who shaped the leading edge of culture and aided in societal change.
3. Tools of communication can replace the need for war through diplomacy, councils, UN, and listening circles.
4. Not speaking our truths creates distance with others. By speaking what we are withholding, we create a space for clear communication and understanding to take place; this is how we form deeper trust and connection.


### Exercice
Reflect:
- Underneath everything you do, everything you say – what are you really trying to say?
- And in saying that, what are you most longing to hear?

Tell it to yourself.



# Upward: Communication Catalyzes
What is the story you are trying to tell? What is the story that compels you to your vision? What is the new story of the world that we are trying to tell together? These are things to think about for the fifth chakra manifesting.

Let’s first start with the stories you tell yourself. What are the voices in your head saying? These voices in turn, affect your communication with yourself, others, and ultimately, what you are able to create.

## Instructions for the 7 Voices Exercise
The aim of this exercise is to create seven different voices of yourself and bring awareness to your inner critic and how you can balance it. The voice: 
- Annihilator 
- Doubter 
- Realist 
- Neutral 
- Doer 
- Dreamer
- Visionary

1. On the floor, imagine a line with each of these boxes.
2. Start with standing in the middle of the line, in your neutral voice. State your intention (*use the same intention you set from Day 29: Consciousness Creates*).
	1. You might say, “I am here”, “I am doing this”, “I am full of power”, etc.
3. Take 1 step to the left to the realist voice. The realist is the first form of the slightly negative voice.
	1. The realist might say, if you're trying to find a job, "*Well, it's a tough job market out there and they don't hire women as much for this kind of work*.”
4. Then, take 1 more step to the left to the next level of your negative critic, this is your doubters voice. 
	1. The doubter says things like, "I doubt that you make a difference. I doubt that anything you've done makes a difference. I doubt that you can even do what you set out to do."
5. Then, take 1 more step to the left. The third most negative critic is what we call the annihilator. When the annihilator speaks we discharge a lot of energy.
	1. The annihilator says, "*You lousy, good for nothing" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
	2. "You're never going to amount to anything. You don't make a heap of difference," blah, blah, blah.*
6. Then, we balance those negative voices by coming into the positive. The balance to the realist is the doer, the one who gets things done.
	1. The realist says, "It's a tough job market" or the realist says, "You're just saying these words. You don't really know me." 
	2. The doer would balance that out by saying, 
	3. "*Well, I'm going to ask some friends. I'm going to ask my husband. I’m going to ask the people that work with me*.”
7. The doubter is balanced with a dreamer. The dreamer thinks about how they would love life to be. 
	1. The dreamer might say, "*Ah, I just know there is the perfect job for me out there somewhere. I know that if I really look and put some effort into it and do my visualization and everything, I'm going to find the right thing*.”
8. The annihilator is balanced by the visionary. It might not even be realistic.
	1. "*I'm going to make the invention that's going to cure cancer*" or save the world. it doesn't have to be realistic because the annihilator isn't realistic either.
	2. In fact, nobody is realistic except for the realist, and the doer can accommodate that.
