## Healing the Psyche
2. Programmed blockages can be caused by shame stemming from controlling parents, age-inappropriate responsibilities, or not being allowed to become autonomous.
3. Having been shamed means you lost your power. We can regain this personal power by owning our responsibilities.
4. To heal our psyche, we must first examine where we are giving away our power and learn to take it back through conscious choice and action.


**Developmental Stage**: 18 months - 3 years (also known as “the terrible twos”) 

**Developmental Tas**k: is to learn autonomy, will, self-definition, impulse control.

At this age, as a child becomes mature enough to develop impulse control and understand language, the will is discovered and exercised. If the parents are too authoritarian, will is squelched; if too lenient, the child gets a false sense of power. The child gets programmed around power by how power is handled in the family.

**Chakra Challenge**: Overcome shame and doubt
**Chakra Gift**: Empowerment


## Healing the Body
1. Bio-Energetic Movements
	-  Charging: Stoking the Fire
	- Discharging: Woodchopper
2. Everyday Movements
	- Breath of Fire
	- Stirring the Cauldron


### Stoking the Fire (Charging) 
Reach arms forward with hands in a fist. Inhale, then exhale pulling elbows back and hands toward the third chakra. Repeat rapidly until you feel a charge.

### Woodchopper (Discharging)
In a standing position, spread legs shoulder width apart. Clasp hands overhead and make loud sound as you bring arms down through your legs, as if you were chopping wood.

Extra Bonus with Partner: Stand face to face with your partner, with your arms starting at the side of you. Try lifting your arms up, while your partner gives resistance.

### Breath of Fire
Rapid diaphragmatic breathing. Sitting up straight, snap your diaphragm in, sending a burst of air out your nostrils. Relax the diaphragm and air naturally comes back in. Do at least 30 snaps of the diaphragm per practice. Can do more if you choose. Use for more containment of your power.

### Stirring the Cauldron
Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, moving your midsection clockwise, as if around the inside of a barrel, while keeping shoulders and hips steady. Use this to loosen up and activate the solar plexus chakra.


## Healing the Spirit
1. The current world paradigm of power unhealthy creates division and a power over others. We must first reclaim our own power to re-create a new paradigm for the world to replace the love of power to the power of love.
2. The antidote to powerlessness is to live from purpose and integrity.
3. We can change the notion of “power” by first changing what it means to us and acting in accordance with those definitions.
4. Healing starts with understanding what are our values and committing to live in alignment with them.


Spirit and world, this chakra represents our relationship to power. The current world paradigm of power creates unhealthy division and a power over others. 


> “Power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.”
> -/ Martin Luther King Jr.


To enact change towards the power of love, we must first reclaim our own power to recreate a new paradigm for the world to replace the love of power with the power of love.

The antidote to powerlessness is to live from purpose and integrity.

# Upward: Power Produces
This is the point where you actually have to get up and DO something.

We are now descending down past the halfway mark between matter and spirit. Things get more physical now, more specific and more practical.

Setting intentions, visualizing, communicating and loving are all fine, and necessary, but they won’t get work done by themselves. For almost every dream, there are many things you have to DO. This brings you into the realm of the third chakra.

The main issue in the third chakra is developing and strengthening the will. First, realize that everything you do is because you are choosing to do it. Then, make a plan and prioritize; without a plan it won’t withstand.

To follow through with your plan, you have to be determined to reach it. That means dealing with all the obstacles that might be in your way.

## Five Common Obstacles
- Obstacle #1: Should-ing Yourself
	- Change “I should” to “I choose to”.
- Obstacle #2: Distractomania
	- Clarify your intention and don’t give energy to any distractions.
- Obstacle #3: Otherizing
	- Remember that other people aren’t going to do it. YOU are.
- Obstacle #4: Don’t-have-itis
	- Work with what you do have and do it.
- Obstacle #5: Tomorrow-crastination
- Plan and set aside time to complete the task.
