**Basic Info**: The first chakra, often called the Root Chakra or Base Chakra
**Location**: Base of the spine, perineum, includes legs and feet
**Element**: Earth.
**Name**: Muladhara, means root support.
**Key Words**: grounding, support, structure, health, embodiment, security, safety, and prosperity


## Training #1: Start to be mindful when you are eating.
Why? Nourishment is a basic form of the body’s survival, and mindfulness helps us stay present, grounded. ==Slowdown==.
Really taste your food, let it land in your belly before you take the next bite. Feel your body. Notice the results.

## Challenge #1: To overcome Fear.
Take an action this week to do one thing you are afraid of. 
- What do you most fear? 
- What does that keep you from doing or having? Where does that fear come from?

Reframe: Feel fear as aliveness. Turn into action to combat your fear (grounding exercise, self-soothing affirmation, speaking up, discharging energy, etc.) Turn FEAR to FAITH.

## Chakra Triumphs:
- Hold your ground and boundaries in a charged situation.
- Eat mindfully.
- Do something wonderful for your body, work out, hike, get a massage.

## Affirmations to reprogram:
- It is safe for me to be here.
- I love my body and trust its wisdom.
- I am IN here.
- The Earth supports me.
- I live in abundance.
- I hold my ground no matter what I encounter.

# Root Chakra
## Healing the Psyche
It's the root, the fundation. The root is about surviving.  First tkink with learn is Trusth or Mistrusth.
Blockage come from the childhood trauma and experience. And all those negative energy goes into the body being build. 

**Developmental Stage**: First year of life
**Developmental Task**: Is to learn Embodiment (living fully IN your body)

This chakra relates to your birth and first year of life, when you are just coming into this world and beginning to live in your body, learning to eat, sleep, crawl, stand, and walk.

At this age, all your survival needs are provided by caretakers. If those needs are met as they should be, the result is a grounded sense of security and embodiment. 
- If they are not met, the result is insecurity and fear.

The first chakra contracts energetically and later may compensate by becoming excessive (too much Earth energy - heavy) or deficient (too little Earth energy - ungrounded).


**Chakra Challenge**: To overcome fear
**Chakra Gift**: Prosperity, stability, security

The main challenge of the Root Chakra is FEAR. Have to see fear as an ally, a teacher, to get rid of it 


We begin each chakra in the psyche, to **make the unconscious, conscious**, so we have a choice to heal. Everything begins with awareness.

1. Programming of the root chakra happens in the first year of life, where a baby learns to trust or fear the world.
2. Programmed blockages can be caused by an unsafe environment, poor mother bonding, or feeling unwanted.
3. The habit of fear blocks the root chakra in our current adult life.
4. To heal our psyche, we must first learn how to embrace fear as an ally, approach ourselves with compassion, and reaffirm our safety here on Earth.

**Practice the Root Chakra Skill Set** for the next three days: Be mindful when you are eating.

#### Exercise Guidelines
1. Reflect on what know about your birth experience – did you feel safe when you were born? 
	1. Were you bottle fed? 
	2. Did you stay in an incubator? 
      

## Healing the Body
1. Bio-Energetic Movements
	- Charging: Standing Bioenergetic Grounding
	- Discharging: Stamp feet
2. Everyday Movements
	-  Press Tailbone to Seat
	- Kundalini Butt Bounce

**Body & Health**: This chakra relates to your legs and feet, your bones, your large intestine and colon. 
Practice opening the leg channels with the charged 
movements below.


###### Charged Movements:

**Standing Bioenergetic Grounding** 
Stand upright, feet hip-distance apart, slightly pigeon-toed. Bend your knees as you inhale, push down and out through the core of both legs on the exhale, straightening legs only 90% of the way. Repeat, coordinating with the breath for several minutes, moving slowly (basically charges the
legs).

**Stamping the feet** 
Lying on your back with knees bent, stamp your feet on the ground, alternating feet, like a kid’s temper tantrum. Make noise and discharge!

Extra Bonus with Partner: Lie on back, pushing feet into partner’s hands to build up charge. Then push out rapidly against partner’s resistance, saying “Mine!” (meaning your roots, your body) End with
kicking into floor, like a temper tantrum. Continue to say “mine” or whatever comes up (discharges legs).

**Chakra Yoga Flow**
Everyday Practices: These are practices you can do anywhere, anytime, in just a few moments. They will help balance your first chakra.
1. Tailbone back
	- Press the tip of the tailbone toward the back of your body whenever you are seated: sitting to eat, working at your computer, driving, or meditating. Notice how it makes it easier to keep the spine erect.
2. Kundalini Butt bounce 
	- Bounce up and down on your butt on a cushion or chair for 30 seconds (time it). Wakes you up doesn’t it? Stimulates fluid movement in the spine and strengthens the legs.

## Healing the Spirit
1. Over generations, our nervous systems have been implanted with trauma and fear, leading to greed and distrust, which perpetuate environmental, financial, and health crises around the world.
2. Humans are wired for the natural world – a world of organic abundance. Thus, being in nature helps us reset our overall systems of safety, trust, and having enough.
3. The first step in healing our spirit and world is to acknowledge our Home, both the body and Earth, as sacred.


**Spirit and World,** this represents our relationship to the Earth, and the protection of nature. Its sacred value is health: in our bodies, our environment, and our world. It is one thing to do something with our body, but the final piece is to connect with Nature and the larger world.

###### Exercice
Reflect and write down a list of things that are refuges for you; a place where you can drop into your body and feel safe.



# Upward: Matter Matters 
To ground your vision is to bring it fully into the material universe. At this level things have solidity, edges, boundaries, weight. They operate by physical laws, known and tested. You can only operate in the material universe through your body, so grounding your vision cannot be done unless you also ground through your own body.

The first and second chakras are the “having” aspect of being, doing, and having. After figuring out how you need to “be” to create your dream, and then “doing” the things that need to be done, you get to “have” the finished product and enjoy its fulfillment. But can you really have it?

The ability to have is not something that comes automatically for many people, but it is something you can develop. Some of this ability is dependent on your inner sense of self-worth – you might say you can’t have more than you think you’re worth.


## Check Your Havingness Factor
“Havingness” is a term that represents our ability to have. How much can you have of a particular thing, such as money, time, friends, love, space for yourself, pleasure, adventure, play, nurturing? Here’s an exercise to determine and then increase your havingness in any area that you choose.

1. Imagine a speedometer that goes from 0 mph to 100 mph. Zero represents the state of no “havingness” and 100 represents 100% deserving and ownership – someone who can truly have the full amount possible. With each question (as an automatic response without thinking too hard about it) allow the speedometer to rise up to your current ability to have:
2. Did your speedometer get to 25? 35? 55? 90? Or was it stuck under 20?
3. If your gauge goes to a low number, close your eyes and imagine raising it a few points. Then imagine what your life would feel like if you were living at that level of havingness. If it’s money you’re working with, imagine moving from 50% to 75%, for example. Then imagine what your bank account, house, clothing, spending, and earning habits would be like living at that level. Gradually increase it until your ability to have matches your want.
