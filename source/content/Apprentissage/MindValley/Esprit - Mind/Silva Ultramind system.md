1. My increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better.
2. Every day, in every way, I am getting better, better, and better.
3. Positive thoughts bring me benefits and advantages I desire.

3. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to the different matter kingdoms: the inanimate matter kingdom, any of its levels and depths; the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence, plant life and animal life, any of its levels and depths; and the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence and an awareness of existence, the human body and mind kingdom, any of its levels and depths.
4. I am now learning to detect abnormalities whenever such abnormalities exist within any kingdom, any level, and any depth, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity.
5. I am now learning to apply corrective measures and to bring back to normalcy any abnormality found within any kingdom, any level, and any depth, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity.

### E.S.P. & the Mental Screen
Intuition is a natural skill which we are all born with and we can be trained in how to optimize it.

Mental screen: how to create and vizualise
creating = imagination
vizualisation = receiving

Imagine giant screen, at least 6 feet large and 20 degree above the line of horizon (so eye go 20 degree which is good for alpha state).

First, go to Alpha state with the 3-2-1. 
Then, on the screen, project a goal you want to see in 3 years. See it with 
- as much color, magnify them,
- pay attention to the feeling and emotion that came out.
- see the peole


**Image streaming** , for better visualisation of color; 
- ask yourself the fabric
- ask yourself each aspect of the image


### The Mental Video Technique: Enlist Higher Intelligence to Solve Problems

the idea is to align with our goal, by asking a higher power to help us. 
Idea is the higher power have a plan for us, a plan in alignment with our soul.


pick a problem you want to solve and you don't have the solution for. 
2 phase:
- in the morning
- at night

Start in the morning, go to beta, eye open. Create a little video of that problem to show to the higher power. Then rsaw the video again at beta, eye close.
Next day, before going to bed, saw the video of the problem again at alpha. Then pass the video to higher power, the way you want - using symbolization -, then see the solution solve step by step.
Go to sleep. 


If between 3 day, don't see sign, do it again. 


# Theta Brainwaves
