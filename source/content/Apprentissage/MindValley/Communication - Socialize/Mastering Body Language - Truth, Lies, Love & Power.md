### Discover the Origins of Body Language
“If people buy you, they're likely to buy what goes with you.”

1) If someone is comfortable with you, there's a good chance they'll give you a fair hearing and say YES to you.
2) People create 90% of their impressions about you in under four minutes.
3) The art of reading body language is to read a person's emotional condition, match it with what they're saying, and then look at the context and circumstances.


exercice: 
- cold reading outside
- cold reading of yourself

### The Rules for Accurate Reading
> “Do not interpret a gesture in isolation.”

1. Like all languages:
	1. body language has words, sentences, and punctuation.
2. The 3 Rules of Accurate Reading
	- Read gestures in clusters of three.
	- Read gestures in context.
	- Look for congruence.
3. Applying the three rules makes you more intuitive, have more influence, and helps you build stronger relationships.


### The Law of Cause & Effect
1) Whatever emotion you are experiencing is likely to be reflected in your body language.
2) If you intentionally hold a gesture, you’ll match its corresponding attitude.
3) Purposely changing your body language changes how you feel and how others react to you.

If you hold a posture for 30s, you develop the attitude of this gesture. 

### Why Women Are More Perceptive
1) Women are two to three times more perceptive at reading body language than men.
2) People with female-oriented brains can multitask, whereas people with male-oriented brains can do one thing at a time.
3) Women are more perceptive, but men can learn to become more sensitive and aware of body language.﻿

#### On gender behavior
Woman would be better at multitask, which allow them to be better at cold reading. 
Using 5 tones of voice changing, men can only use 2.

Cry baby test: video but no sound, men and woman had to guess what the baby want. 

Woman can talk and listend as the same time.

When men are talking, they take turn.
When woman are talking, just talk, cause woman could be able to talk and listen in the same time.

Men understand the bigger picture while woman take notice of detail. This is why man don't see woman new hair cut. 


### Palm Power & Handshaking
1) How you use your palms is critical to how well you get along with people and how well they accept you.﻿
2) When you shake hands, keep the palm straight, and give the same pressure you receive.
3) Handshakes to Avoid
	- The Double-hander
	- The Elbow Grab
	- The “Dead Fish”

When handshale between men and woman,
- give notice of your handshake.
- give the same pressure you receive
- to woman, carefull of jewelry, can hurt you or creat "bling-bling" sound.

If someone give a to firm handshake, put pressure on the nerf in the wrist.

### The Magic of Smiles & Laughter
“The more you smile, the more positive reactions you’ll get.”
1. Smiling tells another person that you are nonthreatening and asks them to accept you on a personal level.
2. The more you smile, the more positive reactions other people will give you.
3. Laughter is free medicine, and people are more attracted to you when you smile and laugh often.

Smile more, even when appaulogize.

laugh is best medecin laugh 60s a day. Do it in the morning, in front of the mirror and naked. 

Laugh make your visage stay younger, 


###### Theory being smile
Chimpanzee have 2 face, smile or agressif.
In both thet show teeth. The idea is agressif is to show bottom teeth, which are the one we use to bite.
While the smile top teeth, to show I'm not agressif.

We and chimpanzee are the only animal that show teeth without meaning harm (smile). Because we don't have carnivor teeth like tiger.

###### Exercice 
1. Work on your smiling or nonsmiling habits. Look at your photographs from the past.
2. Practice smiling and laughing in front of the mirror every morning.


### How Mirroring Increases Your Influence & Likeability
“When mirroring, copy the speed of speech and the voice.”

1. We mirror other people’s body language as a way of bonding and getting accepted by them
2. In a meeting, watch who is mirroring who,
	1. which can reveal where the final decision-making lies.
	2. so I know who to ask 
3. When mirroring, wait three seconds before mirror someone gesture.

Learn to do it on command. Mirror is like to goal of cooperation.
Drunk or Autist can't mirror, synchronize. 

> the person who is listening is in charge of the face-to-face encounter. 
> As the person who is talking is just repeating what he know.

Men will mostlikely support other men solution. While woman will mostlikely support other women emotion. This is due to the fact that men are more emotionless when talking, hence listener can't know their feeling.

If woman talk about a stressing situation to a men, as a men, my most likely answer is a solution. 
- BUT I should listen and support her emotion.
If men talking to a women, use face as feedback and to support her emotion. 


### Principles of Space & Territory
1. 4 Key Zone Distances:
	- Intimate zone
	- Personal zone
	- Social zone
	- Public zone
2. If you want people to feel comfortable around you, keep your distance; don't touch.
3. The more intimate your relationship is with someone, the closer they'll let you come within their zones.
4. The secret to respecting someone's space is to allow them to stand where they feel comfortable.

### Principles of Space & Territory
4 Key Zone Distances:
- The **Intimate Zone**: Between 6 and 18 inches (15-45 centimeters). 
	- when handshake, we keep it before the intimate zone.
-  The **Personal Zone**: Between 18 inches and 48 inches (46cm-1.22m) 
- The **Social Zone**: Between 4 and 12 feet (1.22-3.6m) 
	- distance we stay from stranger
- The **Public Zone**: Over 12 feet (3.6m) ﻿
	- when in large crown

If you want people to feel comfortable around you, keep your distance, and don't touch.
- The more intimate your relationship is with someone, the closer they'll let you come within their zones.
- The secret to respecting someone's space is to allow them to stand where they feel comfortable.

The size of the key zone depend on the culture too.

> golden rule: keep distance, don't touch !!

When talking to someone, respect the 1st distance they create. And they will, by themself get closer.

### How to Win at an Interview Using Body Language

“What’s remembered is the impression you made.”
1. Most interviewers forget the factual information and ==remember the first impression you make==.
2. Remember, it is only a job interview. The more you practice, the more likely it is that you will get the job.
3. Research the company, its goals, and its mission statements, so you can bring them into conversations.
4. If someone keeps you waiting for an interview, show that you're busy and you don’t waste your time.

Dress the way the perfect employee of this company dress like. 
Hold think in left hand, as your right hand always ready for handshake.
The less object, the better as you will look more organize. So put jacket, hat ... at the reception.


When walking through a door (like an office door), maintain the same speed !!
Walk like president walk, semi-marathon like, cause it draw attention and confidence.

Use the person's name at least twice in the firs 15s and never talk for more than 30s at a time. 

Sit: on the edge of the chair, so have bigger range of motion for hand. And angle body aways from the interviewer, as sitting in front is a Competitive/Defensive position. 

In Western country, keep the hand below the chin and finger toghether.
