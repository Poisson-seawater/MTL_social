### How to Sound Confident
The way we say “hello” indicates our **warmth** and **competence**. 
1. Ask when you have a question and state when you want to tell something. 
	1. Avoid question inflection and use neutral or downward inflection when pitching (avoid sentence that heard like a question)
2. The best way we can move into the competence part of the scale is using more breath and space. 
3. We can hear emotion from our vocal power. 
	1. To add more warmth, add more emotion.
	2. As long as the emotion is real, it's going to translate into your vocal power.
