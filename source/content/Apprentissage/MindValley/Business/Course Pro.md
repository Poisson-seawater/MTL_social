Speak naturally on camera as if you’re having a conversation with a friend.

The two pillars of consciousness engineering consist of installing 
- a new model of reality in someone and 
- teaching them a new system for living.

### Model of Online Learning
1. There are two main types of courses: MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and CBCs (Cohort Based Courses).

2. The sign-up rate for MOOCs is high, but the completion rate on average is only around 5%.

3. There are three main advantages of the CBCs:
	- Based on cohorts with concrete start dates.
	- Contain bite-size and digestible pieces of information.
	- Offer the option to interact with the community.

### Infuse your values into your brand
1. There are three main personal brand and style concepts: brand frequency, your personal style, and brand photography.
2. To become iconic, you have to have a narrow brand frequency. Singular brand frequency is super important.
3. You can incorporate what you love with your style, but you want to ensure that you have a style.
4. Good photography uplifts the sales up to 20%, speaks to people subconsciously, and builds credibility.

### Overcome toxic perfectionism
1. Toxic perfectionism may prevent you from taking any action. It’s better to have a smaller, shorter course completed than getting stuck with massive aspirations that may lead nowhere.

2. Start small by creating a minimum viable product that will give you valuable feedback from your audience so you can improve the content and fill the gaps if needed.

### Strategy of Building Charisma:  
- Tell a story and exert emotion.
- Address your audience directly.
- Add extra energy.
- Address the potential objections.
- Use positive body language.

### The pajama draft
1. The pajama draft is filming your entire content from the beginning till the end, dressed up in something ridiculous.
2. The idea behind the pajama draft is to present your entire course from the beginning till the end with zero pressure.
3. Pajama Draft Steps:
	- Set up your camera or phone on a tripod.
	- Press record and start presenting.
	- If you make a mistake, keep going.
	- Have fun with it.
	- Delete the video

# Your Basic Video Set-Up 
Tips regarding review and start. Extrem review are usually full of emotion, hence should take advantage to have information.

No need to buy expensive material. Cheap one may do the job perfectly too. 


## Microphone: 
- Getting a mic is the most important;  having low-quality audio automatically turns people off, 
	- The video quality doesn’t have to be incredible as long as the audio is crisp. 
- If you have a small budget and can buy just one thing, invest in a mic first 
- Recommend a lavalier style mic  https://amzn.to/3pYATjO) 
	- can be positioned close to your mouth, which allows it to pick up a crisp sound without the background noise 
- If prefer a [shotgun mic](https://amzn.to/3MMS15W), easier to attach to your phone/camera, you can do it. 
	- However, shotgun mics are directional so unless you are in a quiet place, directly in front of it, it may pick up the background noise. 

## Lamps: 
- Should take advantage of natural light outdoors; rules in mind: 
	- the sun should never be behind you as you will have issues with exposure. Ideally, the sun is behind the camera so your face is fully visible.
	- take advantage of the "golden hour" as the light is softer 
	- avoid wearing sunglasses. 
		- When people can't see your eyes, you lose trust.
	- bear in mind that when filming outdoors, having a decent lavalier mic is especially important considering all the external noise.
		- test audio first
- Getting a [ring lamp](https://amzn.to/3MEOcjn ) is a great low-budget option, especially if you are filming in close proximity to your phone camera.
	- The main benefit is that they are super easy and quick to use. Due to their ring shape, they provide an equal amount of light from all directions, thereby, eliminating the possible shadows. 
	- You can also easily adjust the intensity with remote control. Overall, great quality to price ratio when you are getting started on a budget. : 
- To make the home studio more professional you could set up a[ three-point lighting system](https://amzn.to/3t7BIsN ). 
	- Here’s a [short YouTube to explain it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqMQZG68Wkc )  
	- is especially useful if you plan to record more than just your face. It is more expensive than ring lamps, 
	- better option is plan to create a permanent mini studio. . 

## Tripod: 
- If you are using your phone to film, don't preoccupy yourself with paying for a top-quality tripod.
- Also, if you decide to buy a ring lamp, a lot of them have a phone holder. 


## Background: 
- Having a nice, clean background is essential when creating a video course.
	- You can either use a natural home/office background or buy a backdrop 
- If you opt for having a natural background, make sure that it's not distracting. 
	- May be tempting to have a lot of fun items in the video frame, but always make sure that the main focus of your viewers is on you. 
	- If in doubt, less is more, and the cleaner, the better.

## Software: 
- Rather than filming with your built-in phone camera, it's better to use software that gives you extra filming options and improves the image quality. 
- FiLMiC Pro is one of the best apps on the market and is very affordable. 
	- It allows  to customize your videos (e.g. changing exposure) and improves the quality overall 
- DoubleTake app allows  to film a video with multiple lenses at the same time. 
		- It's especially exciting in the context of the home studio as you can have two different shots filmed at the same time. BUT only on iPhone
