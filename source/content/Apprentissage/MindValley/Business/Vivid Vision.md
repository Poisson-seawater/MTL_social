- [x] all done

Write down the key idea of your life like you would write a Financial Statement (here call a Vivid Vision). Do it for the next year end, year end of death day.
- see the pdf as example

Rules:
1. A Vivid Vision outlines what the company looks, acts and feels like, but it does not explain how to make it happen.
2. A Vivid Vision should imagine the business three years in the future.
3. Without a Vivid Vision, businesses are more prone to misalignment and frustration between employees and leaders.


### How to Write a Vivid Vision
1. The CEO must be the visionary behind the Vivid Vision.
	1. each VP write on from their job + how to make it.
2. Write your Vivid Vision out of the office.
3. “Mind map” your Vivid Vision to brainstorm the future of your business three years out
	1. mindmap = the brouillon of the Vivid Vision
	2. then make Stakeholder agree.



#### Your Vivid Vision’s Mind Mapping:
The Vivid Vision is much more of a qualitative description of your company than it is a quantitative measurement or series or measurable goals. You don't need to include a lot of numbers and metrics in the document either, it's a lot less measurable. 

##### A. Mind mapping 
To allows you to brainstorm without having to provide explanations of strategies for achieving the desired goal. Start including thoughts related to your:
1. Core purpose.
2. The BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal).
3. Core values.
4. Mission statement.

##### B. One key step in creating a Vivid Vision
Is to start thinking about certain question peering into the future:
- What do you see?
- Why do you want to be there?
- What materializes in front of you as the epitome of success?

Note: Focus on describing what you see over the next three years.

##### C. Imagine 
that you’re filming every aspect of your business: your employees, customers, supplier relationships, etc.
- Play the film in your mind.
- What does the big picture and the details of your business look like three years out?


##### D. Think about crazy stuff.
Maybe something too outlandish to share at a meeting or even consider seriously. Write it down.

#### Vivid Vision - Questions Checklist:
You will have the time to make your first Mind map more specific but first, let’s keep imagining. 

Look at the road in front of you. Don’t focus on or worry about how you’ll make it happen. 

Pretend you traveled in a time machine into the future. The date is December 31 st. Three years
from now. You are walking around your company’s offices with a clipboard in hand…

##### What do you see in the office space?
- What do you hear, what’s the buzz or energy like?
- What are clients saying?
- What does the media write about you?
- What kind of comments are your employees making at the water cooler?
- What is the buzz about you in your community?
- What is your marketing like? Are you marketing your goods/services globally now? Are you launching new online and TV ads?
- How is the company running day to day? Is it organized and running like a clock?
- What kind of stuff do you do every day? Are you focused on strategy, team building, customer relationships, etc.?
- What do the company’s financials reveal?
- How are you funded now?
- How are your core values being realized among your employees?

##### Think about the ‘Circles of Influence’ that touch your company:
- What are suppliers saying about you?
- What are your customers writing about you online?
- How are your employees describing you on Indeed, Glassdoor, etc?
- How would your accountant, lawyer, etc, speak about your company?
#####  It’s time to keep writing after your Vivid Vision’s dreaming. 
Every area or your Organizational Chart needs to be described. 
Add to what you already have, 2-3 bullet points or sentences about each area:
1. Operations
2. Sales
3. Marketing
4. Finance
5. IT (Information Technology)
6. Customer Service
7. HR (Human Resources)
8. Your C-Suite

### Creating the First and Second Draft
It’s time to start creating the first and second drafts of your Vivid Vision. 
- The first draft is strictly for your eyes only. 

Let’s learn a bit more about the drafting process before you get started.

1. First and second drafts allow you to organize your Vivid Vision into sections and identify any areas you may have missed.
2. Don’t worry about them being perfect.
3. Hand your second draft to your leadership team so they can help you fill any blanks.
4. Ideally, keep your final draft to 4-6 pages.


#### The First Draft
It is a starting point for you so that you can see where you may need to add more ideas. This is a draft that only you are going to read. Don't worry about it being perfect.
1. Your first draft will end up being 2 or 3 pages long.
2. Start to organize and pull all the points together from your Mind maps and checklists, create sections, making sure that you're not repeating any of the points.
3. While writing up this rough draft it will also inspire other ideas or complete sections that you can quickly add in while typing it up as well.
4. You may also see a few sections where you can cut back the “happy talk” too.
5. If it'll feel like it's probably 80% completed, don't worry. Again, no one is going to read this document.

#### The Second Draft
It will be longer, perhaps 3-4 pages, and you’ll show it to your leadership team.
1. It’s not at all meant to be read by anyone internally or external to the company yet.
2. Ask your leadership team to read it to see if there are any areas that you’re missing which need to be added.
3. Their job is simply to spot if you’re missing any areas that can add color to the document when it’s done. You are not asking for their OK on any part of it.
4. After receiving feedback from your leadership team, don’t forget to include your company's core purpose, your BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal), and your company’s Core Values. (State only your core values, otherwise expanding will make the document too long).
5. This draft is the final one you’ll be writing up before you hand it to a professional copywriter. So, it needs to make sense.
6. A suggestion is always to keep the final draft around 4-6 pages maximum in length – and that’s after the design elements are added.

**Additional Information**: When writing up versions, could use “Siri” or “Otter.ai” to walk around and digitally record sections of it. You can edit it all together afterward so you end up with one solid final draft.



Copywriting & Design
Welcome back. We hope you’ve successfully completed the first and second drafts of your Vivid
Vision, because today we’re going to look at polishing it to make it truly inspiring for your entire
team.
Key Learning Points
1. Use professional copywriters and designers to really make your Vivid Vision shine.
2. Remember your Vivid Vision should be no more than 6 pages including the cover. Write it
in the present tense and in your own words.
3. Add branded graphic design elements to make your Vivid Vision reflect your business


### Copywriting & Design
The job of the copywriter is to take your final draft and really make it shine. Your copywriter will ensure that it flows, that it's grammatically correct, and that it also magnetizes and pulls people together. Keep in mind:
1. Your Vivid Vision should be written in the present tense because what you're doing is describing the company three years in the future as if it's already come true.
2. Make sure that it reads well, make sure that it has all the correct punctuation.
3. Don’t add quotes from famous people – keep this as a document that is 100% your words.
4. Once the copywriter has perfected the wording, go with the graphic design elements.
5. Get a designer to add all of your company's colors and design elements to really make it feel like your brand.
6. If you decide to add photos make sure to add really good and high-resolution ones.
7. Resist the urge to turn it into a Slide Deck as well – once again – designers often have a different thought with what you’re doing it for.
8. The final 4–6 page PDF version with copywriting and design, is one that will be emailed to everyone and read by everyone quarterly.

As all your employees, potential employees, customers, potential customers, suppliers, bankers, everyone is going to be reading this Vivid Vision, you want to bring them into the future of your company as much as possible, pulling them towards you.

**Remember**: The design is just as important as copywriting. As far as the design elements go for your Vivid Vision, as long as your website looks great, your Vivid Vision should look and feel like your website and brand.


Sharing Your Vivid Vision
Internally
When others read your Vivid Vision, they need to experience a moment of awe and wonder. If
their jaws don’t drop a little, you need to think bigger. And the first people you need to share it is
your team.
Today we will look at how to roll out your Vivid Vision, how to handle resistance, and when to
course-correct.
Key Learning Points
1. When others read your Vivid Vision, if their jaws don’t drop a little, you need to think
bigger.
2. People inside your company are the touchpoints with the outside world. They should be
the first ones involved and engaged with your three-year Vivid Vision.
3. Remember: There will be backlash. The future is scary to people who have become too
comfortable in the present.
4. Reassure people that some points in the document will happen sooner than others, this is
a three-year project.
Your Actions for Today
1. Share your Vivid Vision internally and make it an unforgettable experience for you and
everyone else!
2. Optional: Record your Vivid Vision as an audio and listen to it as a meditation.


### Sharing Your Vivid Vision Internally
This process involves sharing your Vivid Vision with all of your employees, all of your board members, and anyone inside the four walls of your company. 

Start with this group to ensure that everyone on the team really understands and is excited about the Vivid Vision, keep in mind people inside your company are the touchpoints with the outside world:

1. Try to get everyone in the same room. This will, of course, depend on the size of your organization:
	1. If yours is a 30-person company, you can do it with everyone at once.
	2. If yours is a 500-person company, you may want to break it by business area, meeting with each business area or division one at a time.
	3. If yours is a 5,000-person organization, then you will be meeting with people in shifts.
	4. **Note**: Whether you are a “solopreneur” or you have a shorter team, the process remains the same.
2. Begin by handing everyone a hard copy of the Vivid Vision. The entire group is going to read it out loud, one person at a time. 
3. While the reading is being done, the CEO’s job is to look around the room to gauge people’s reactions. (*Notice which people are engaged, excited, and invested and notice who isn’t*).
4. After the group has read through the pages, you want each employee to circle any of the sentences or phrases that most excite and inspire them.
5. Ask them to share their thoughts with the group. (*Keep in mind this is not a forum for discussion or debate, just a space to listen to your team’s thoughts*).

**Note**: If by any chance you can’t manage to gather people together physically, you can also use this process virtually and remotely.
- This activity exists for employees to simply understand where the CEO wants to lead the organization. 
- By getting your people to think, “What if?” they become engaged and aligned.
- In later meetings, there’ll be opportunities to discuss how each statement will be accomplished,
	- but for now, this material just needs to sink in and provide a source of contemplation and inspiration for them.

**Additional Information**: recommended to wait at least a quarter before an external rollout.


### Sharing Your Vivid Vision Externally
Now that everyone within the organization fully understands and is rallying behind the Vivid Vision, it’s time to share it with the rest of the world.

1. Sharing your Vivid Vision helps everyone understand the role they play in your business.
2. It tells clients, customers, investors and suppliers why the company is exciting and what it will be like three years from now, rather than what it’s like today.
3. With a shared Vivid Vision, everyone associated with your business is aligned, making it easier to overcome obstacles, or pivot along the way.


### Reinforcing the Vivid Vision
The more you reinforce and share your Vivid Vision the more it aligns people and becomes true. 
1. A good method to reinforce your Vivid Vision is to open it quarterly and highlight the sentences that have come true.
2. Reviewing your Vivid Vision monthly with a coach is also a powerful tool.
3. Three months before starting the next Vivid Vision exercise, the CEO should get offsite again to lean into the future.

### “Can You Imagine?” Wall
Now you have your Vivid Vision. Can you imagine what your business will look like? Can you imagine your employees contributing new potential paths for future Vivid Visions?

1. A “Can You Imagine?” wall opens space for anyone in the company to post great ideas aligned to your Vivid Vision.
	1. juste a table with colomne IDEA and WHO
	2. To write down ideas that your employees, your customers, your suppliers and yourself can imagine your company doing or looking like, 10, 5, 3 years out...
2. Just committing to writing ideas on the wall seems to make ideas happen.
3. A “Can You Imagine?” wall helps you create more buzz about your business and makes it a great place to work.



### Personal Vivid Vision
Is it possible to lean out into the future and examine your personal life? The answer is yes. When creating a personal Vivid Vision, it’s important to compartmentalize, just like we did for our
business. But rather than things like finance, marketing, and IT, we’re going to divide our personal Vivid Vision into the “Five F’s”.

1. There are 5 categories of life to consider when writing your personal Vivid Vision: 
	1. Fitness,
	2. Faith, 
	3. Finance, 
	4. Family, 
	5. and Friends.
2. Writing our personal Vivid Vision is like making a deal with ourselves to deliver the future that we want and keep us focused on getting there.
3. Lean out three years into the future and get specific about what you see your ideal life to be.
4. Writing a personal Vivid Vision is not the time to think about how you will get there, only that you will get there.
5. Write down only positive things about your future self.


#### Fitness:
1. How is your appearance different than it is today?
2. Physically, what shape are you in?
3. How healthy are you?
4. You have three whole years to make your fitness goals happen, and in that time, you can improve your diet, get more exercise, take up a new sport or activity, get more rest,reduce stress, limit alcohol consumption, and adopt a healthier lifestyle.
5. When you lean out into the future, the person you see reflected in the mirror should be a person who has spent three dedicated years waiting for that very day.

#### Faith:
1. What does your spiritual life look like three years from now?
2. Is the person in the mirror a reflective being or an automaton mindlessly going through this life?
3. If you have taken the time and effort to vividly visualize your life, chances are you’re the former.
4. So, how do you see yourself being even more reflective in your future? What does that look like to you?

#### Finance:
1. What strides have you made as you look at your bank book?
2. Know where you want to be in your career three years from today.

Be specific with your goals— have definitive figures you’re looking at. You will work out the means of getting there later, but you need to first have a destination in mind. Once you know where that place is, you can reverse engineer your way step-by step.

#### Family:
Dare to envision what is possible, knowing that your destiny is in your own hands even as it involves connections with others:
1. What does your relationship with your spouse or partner look like? Have you grown closer?
2. Do you have more shared interests?
3. Is there forgiveness for offenses?
4. Are you a better life partner in three years than you are now?
5. Ask yourself what your ideal relationship looks like, knowing that you’ll soon work to make that happen.
6. If you’re a parent, where do you see your relationship with your children in three years?

No relationship in your life is as in flux as that between you and your children.
Other important relationships to consider are those with your parents and siblings. As your parents age, you will take on new responsibilities, and that will likely affect the interactions you have with your siblings.

#### Friends:
1. Are you the kind of friend whom you would want to have?
2. Do you see yourself as growing your network in your future life or simply growing ever closer to the friends you already have?

Friendships require upkeep and commitment and grow stronger or fade out depending on decisions you make. If you’re conscious of these choices and take efforts to be a good friend, your relationships will last.

One of the easiest ways to reinforce your personal Vivid Vision and imprint the ideas in your mind, is to read it and re-read it over and over again. The more frequently that you re-read your personal vivid vision, the stronger the visions will be for you.

Finally, Cameron recommends reviewing it with a spouse, partner or coach monthly. When you share your vision with others, especially your spouse, or partner and a coach, they will help hold you accountable to it.



#### Vivid Vision for Your Family
1. Your family’s Vivid Vision should be 2 or 3 pages at most.
2. Go beyond economic issues. Think of things that your family values and the sorts of activities you want to do together.
3. An ideal time to write your family’s Vivid Vision is during a vacation or new year.
