### Knowing Who Your Team Is
How to set a proper “teaming out” and strategically build your team. 
- Create a RAP, meaning a Relationship Action Plan.

You can get closer to achieve your RAP through the FTDAOR: 
- F – Focus
- T – Target
- D – Define 
- A – Align 
- O – Outreach
- R – Review and renew 

###### Prioritezed people
When it comes to leading, have to prioritized.

You can list people through an ABC; A the most important one. Set a metric of the movement of the relationship from -1 to 5: 
- 5: Your partners, someone you trust and are very close with.
- 4 
- 3: An acquaintance. 
- 2 
- 1
- 0: You don't know the person yet, but you want to get to know them. 
- -1: Strained Relationship. 

Keep in mind your value statement, what you bring to those individuals and how you can serve them.

Here are 6 important steps to establish **Re-Contracting** for a better future: 
1. Schedule 
2. Create the right space and mindset 
3. Assess and Acknowledge

### Venturing Beyond the Reasonable 
This session is about clearly understanding the steps needed to set a moonshot. 

Step 1 Start by defining your moonshot relative to your vision and your 10x goals. 
- Make it clear, energy creating and anchored to your purpose. 

Step 2 What concrete objective can you achieve this year (or this month) that will put your moonshot on schedule? 

Step 3 What 3 concrete objectives can you achieve this month (or week) that will put that goal on schedule? 

Step 4 Find proof: What evidence could you provide your team that the moonshot is working? 

Step 5 Action: What single action can you take right now to make progress?



### Alignment, Agility, and Radical Adaptability
The CPS (Collaborative Problem Solving) process is an important element in the co-creation of goals and figuring out the “10 Big Hills” that will move you closer to your moonshot’s vision.

Here is a step-by-step process of CPS to identify the 10 Big Hills and initiate sprints: 
1. Schedule the meeting. 
2. Set the tone for the meeting.
3. Craft the CPS question carefully. 
	- Ex: “What are the 5-10 critical goals we have to achieve to break down success and make our moonshot a reality?”. 
4. Define an owner for the question. 
5. Invite the right people and engage. 
6. Get people pre-reading. 
7. Have the meeting and define the agenda. 
8. Transfer into project management and communication platforms. 
	- Make sure you have SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely).


### Measuring True Success with Outcomes 
Traditionally, accountability is what the leader holds members of the team to, but with co-elevation, the team also begins to hold each other accountable. 

About the importance of accountability and setting a new contract where the team also begins to hold each other accountable. 
There are 3 levels of accountability:
1. Self Accountability: Keep yourself accountable and role model others to take accountability.
2. Holding others accountable: Being clear and assuring that everyone knows what they are held accountable for. 
3. Peer-to-peer accountability: Collective commitment to crossing the finish line together

### Neutralizing Risk
This lesson is all about foreseeing and preparing for possible risks in the future. **Bulletproofing** is a process for mitigating risks during your pursuit of the 10 Big Hills and beyond. 

Find below some steps to set a bulletproof meeting for each of your 10 Big Hills: 
1. The individual leading the hill reports out. 
2. The team actively participates here in support of the individual to root out unsuspected risks. The individual reports out. 
3. Everyone breaks into small groups using the standard format for bulletproofing to report back: 
	1. How would we challenge the report out? Where do we identify risks we might not see? 
	2. How might we innovate? What crazy ideas might not have been considered? 
	3. How can we help? 
4. After the reports out from each group the sprint leader reviews with Yes/No/Maybe. 
5. Go into the next Big Hill.


### Creating Safety and Opening Up
Creating **psychological safety** is an important element for any team. As a leader, you can create it through vulnerability and openness. 

Some practices to create and maintain an environment of psychological safety are: 
- Sweet and Sour sharing 
	- Everybody shares the sweet thing that is going on with them. 
	- Everybody shares the sour thing that is going on with them.
- PPC sharing (Personal Professional Check-in). 
	- What is going on in your life personally? 
	- What is going on in your life professionally? 
- LSD sharing (Long Slow Dinner) to address key questions, for example: 
	- “What experience of your past do you think most contributes to how you show up and see the world today?” 

Creating psychological safety doesn’t just happen by accident, you need to create and maintain an environment for it, and the practices already mentioned will help you with that.


### Generating and Elevating Energy
This lesson focuses on the importance of energy and some simple strategies for generating and elevating it. Here are some simple strategies to generate and elevate energy continuously: 
- Celebration and gratitude 
- Personalized recognition 
- Celebrating publicly 
- Celebrating together
- Adding a Gratitude Circle at the end of meetings

Research shows it's less about “the winning” and more about the celebration and reward associated with winning. As you celebrate, you can make a point to reconnect the team to the purpose and moonshot, and give each person the credit for achieving the overall mission. 


### Communicating Clearly and Candidly
Communication is an essential element to achieve transparency among teams. Here are some tips for improving communication: 
- Practice: Expressing your opinions more frequently and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. 
- Read: It improves your vocabulary and helps you to get more comfortable with more complex ideas.

Creating transparent communication implies: 
1. The willingness to change
2. Speaking your mind 
3. Being bold 
4. . Having more candor 

One good and fun way to create more candor is called a **Yoda Moment**. It is an insightful moment in the middle of a meeting where you can bring difficult topics that are bothering the team (those that are like the “elephant in the room”), and address them together: 
- You can do so by picking some Yodas from your team at the beginning of a meeting. 
	- Pause at any point in the meeting and ask your Yodas about that thing that has not been said yet. 
- Another way is to include the Yoda Moment in the middle of the meeting’s agenda. 
	- Everybody breaks into small groups. Every small group replies to the following question: “What is it that people are not saying?
	- Come back and discuss the main insights

### Going Higher Together
Keith talks about the basics of giving feedback and how to lead spaces for your team to give feedback to each other. There are 3 essential steps in this process: 
1. Serve: Find a way to be of service to them, their mission, their dreams. 
2. Share: Share something about yourself, personally or professionally. Be open about your areas for growth. 
3. Care: “People do not care how much you know until they know how much you care”. Your team needs to have complete confidence that you care about them, and that feedback is in service of them. 

Here are some of the basics of providing individual feedback: 
- Start with leading them to discovery with questions. - Ask for permission to offer support. 
- Set time/place - and make sure it’s the right place for them. 
- Own how candor lands. 
- Praise the past.
- Focus on the future and give them power. 
- Recognize it’s just feedback and they can do what they want to with it.
- Set the expectation of accountability. 
- Welcome their feedback. 


### Continuously Improving Processes 
How we do things, as leaders, needs to change right alongside how the market is changing, what our customers are expecting of us, and what the competition is offering. 

A good method for refining processes and collaborating in small groups is called 5x5x5. It helps you redefine the idea of coaching your team, by allowing the team to see each other as coaches and constantly improve processes. 

It only takes 15 mins. In groups of three, one person shares a challenge and the other two give insights. Here is the breakdown of the 5x5x5 method and some tips to make the best out of it. 

###### The 5x5x5 Method
Split in groups of 3. Inside the groups, each person takes turns as follows: 
- First 5 mins: Share a challenge. 
	- Be transparent.
	- Be as detailed as possible. 
- Second 5 mins: Group peppers with questions. 
	- Use the Socratic method for all questions. 
	- Probe deeper. 
- Final 5 mins: Receive advice. 
	- Double Barrel Candor 
	- The advice should be formulated as a suggestion, not direction: "Might I suggest…" 
	- Ask for accountability 
- Expresses gratitude for the insights received.
- Close the circle with clear action and next steps. 


**Note**: The Socratic method is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.



### Succeeding Through Failure 
Handling failure and turning it into success is essential for any leader. Failure can and should propel you forward. As Keith said, “If you are not failing from time to time, you are not setting your sights high enough”.

You can successfully handle failure through something called AAR (After Action Review) and focusing on four important questions:
1. What were we trying to accomplish?
2. What happened? 
3. Was the goal attainable? 
4. How should we do it differently next time? 

**Note**: After any AAR it’s important to share what you learned.



### Leading Up
Great leaders lead in all directions, including up. There are ways to earn leadership and collaboration with people who are higher than you at your workplace. Regardless of your position, there is always someone that could be led above you. 

Here are some good ways to lead up effectively: 
- Earn permission to lead: Serve, Share and Care
-  Go above and beyond.
- Consider their north star. 
- Lighten their load.
- Sense your bosses’ priorities and imperatives. 
- Be curious, take interest in their initiative. 
- Ask questions. 
- Show curiosity - about them, their experience, their expertise. 
- Be sharp with your time
- Make it systematic
