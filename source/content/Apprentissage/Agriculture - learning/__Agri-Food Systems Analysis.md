[Agri-Food Systems Analysis](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:DoaneX+SAG-603x+1T2020/home)

###### Goal: 
- Explain the need for a country-level collaboration among various agencies in finance, commerce, agriculture, health, and environmental protection.
- Discuss the complexity and what the impact of changes in policies, business practices, and technologies has on global food systems and food supply chains.
- Evaluate how a global food system and supply chains are affected by diverse participants with conflicting interests.
- Analyze how individual’s lifestyles, international business operations, policies of health care, energy, and food, environmental changes, and so on impact global food systems’ biodiversity and ecosystem.
- Identify not only economic but also social and environmental impacts from global business practices on individuals, communities, and society. 
- Assess how the sustainability of agriculture and food systems are evaluated and measured, and describe solutions to economic, social, and environmental problems.

### Module 1: Introduction to Systems and Systems Thinking

#### What is a system
A system is a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting
network.
- ex: *the cardiovascular system is just one of 11 systems that make up the body.*

#### Social-Ecological Systems
Food systems can be considered social-ecological systems.
Panarchy is a term devised to describe these complex systems and offers an important framework for understanding them.


anarchy is the structure in which systems, including those of nature (e.g., forests and
prairies) and of humans (e.g., agriculture and distribution of food), as well as combined
human-natural systems (e.g., agrifood systems), are interlinked in continual adaptive cycles
of growth, accumulation, restructuring, and renewal.
Parnarchy describes these interactions.
Panarchy is a framework of nature's rules, hinted at by the name of the Greek god of
nature- Pan - whose persona also evokes an image of unpredictable change.
The panarchy framework connects adaptive cycles in a nested hierarchy and so as such, it’s
important to understand both what the adaptive cycle is and that in complex, social ecological
systems like agrifood systems, there are multiple adaptive cycles all doing their own thing,
yet impacting all the others simultaneously.


It consists of four distinct phases: ‘growth or exploitation’ (r); ‘conservation’
(K) of established patterns and resource distribution; ‘collapse or release’ (Ω); and reorganization
(α).
The adaptive cycle is often drawn like an infinity symbol or Möbius loop that joins
these four phases.

We often think about and focus on the growth and conservation phases of systems.
Think about the mantra of continuous economic growth you hear about on the news.
However, our current understanding of systems dynamics indicates that two additional functions - release and reorganization - are also needed.

#### Spatial Scale and Typologies of Food Systems

the typology of food systems we present here, we are thinking about classifying food
systems based on how production occurs and at what scale, which portions of society are
involved in production and distribution, and the rationale underlying production, distribution,
and consumption.


FARMING: usually in develop and poor counrty, small and family farm sell to the people of the country. While big farm export. -> just like in Brazil. 


#### Community base farming
Like the globalized variant, community-based alternative food systems define prescriptive goals but oppose many elements of the globalized corporate food system. The community food system primer (Wilkins and Eames-Sheavly 2010) states that "a community food system is a food system in which food production, processing, distribution, and consumption are integrated to enhance the environmental, economic, social and nutritional health of a particular place". Three examples of these prescriptive goals within common components of community food systems are:

1. Organic agriculture as a way to reduce contamination of food with pesticides and improve the ecosystem health of farms
2. Farmers markets and community-supported agriculture schemes that allow consumers to more directly support the activities of farmers
3. An emphasis on supporting the activities of small and medium producers and resisting pressures for production and distribution enterprises to grow larger and larger


### Module 3: The History of Agrifood Systems and Society

#### The Neolithic (Agricultural) Revolution
The shift from a hunter-gatherer society to
an agrarian society changed our species and our planet.

Because cultivation of plants requires more labor than hunting and gathering, we can assume
that Stone Age humans gave up their former ways of life reluctantly and slowly.

But between about 8000 and 3500 B.C., bands of hunter-gatherers began domesticating plants
and animals, quit the nomadic life, building villages and towns that endured for thousands
of years.

#### Agriculture's Impact on Society
In order to determine how agriculture has impacted society, it’s important to know what the societies that predated agrarian society (hunter-gatherers) were like. Because there are current, intact hunter-gatherer societies that have been studied, we know quite a bit about them.
The most important thing we know about them  that hunter-gatherers were and are peaceful egalitarians.


#### Hunter Gatherer Societies
During the twentieth century, anthropologists discovered and studied dozensof different hunter-gatherer societies, in various remote parts of the world, who had been nearly untouched by modern influences.

Wherever they were found--in Africa, Asia, South America, or elsewhere; in deserts or
in jungles--these societies had many characteristics in common.
- The people lived in small bands, of about 20 to 50 persons (including children) per band, who moved from camp to camp within a relatively circumscribed area to follow theavailable game and edible vegetation.
- The people had friends and relatives in neighboring bands and maintained peaceful relationships with neighboring bands.
- Warfare was unknown to most of these societies, and where it was known it was the result of interactions with warlike groups of people who were not hunter-gatherers.

In each of these societies, the dominant cultural ethos was one that emphasized individual autonomy, non-directive child-rearing methods, nonviolence, sharing, cooperation, and consensual decision-making.

Their core value, which underlay all of the rest, was that of the equality of individuals.

We citizens of a modern democracy claim to believe in equality, but our sense of equality is not even close that of hunter-gatherers. The hunter-gatherer version of equality meant that each person was equally entitled to food, regardless of his or her ability to find or capture it; so food was shared.
It meant that nobody had more wealth than anyone else; so all material goods were shared.
It meant that nobody had the right to tell others what to do; so each person made his or her own decisions.
It meant that even parents didn't have the right to order their children around; hence the non-directive child-rearing methods.
It meant that group decisions had to be made by consensus; hence no boss, "big man," or chief.

There are some variations from culture to culture, of course, and not all of the cultures are quite as peaceful and fully egalitarian as others, but the generalities are the same.

The hunter-gatherer way of life, unlike the agricultural way of life that followed it, apparently depended on intense cooperation and sharing, backed up by a strong egalitarian ethos; so, hunter-gatherers everywhere found ways to maintain a strong egalitarian ethos.

A shift to an agrarian society brought with it some negative societal consequences. 

As noted earlier, cultivation of plants and domestication of animals requires more labor
than hunting and gathering.
So to did building villages and towns and then supporting populations of thousands of
people working as non-cultivating specialists (merchants, traders, craftspeople, etc).
The need for labor was one factors that led institution of slavery.
- Slavery dates back to prehistoric times and was apparently modeled on the domestication of animals.

From the earliest periods of recorded history, slavery was found in the world's most "advanced" regions.

The earliest civilizations--along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus Valley of India--the birthplace of agriculture--had slavery.

When Europeans began to colonize the New World at the end of the 15th century, they were well aware of the institution of slavery.

Save people but Pesticide and Engrai. 

Also even though increase rendment / land -> wild landscape are disapearing.



### Module 4: Agrifood Systems and Their Relationship to Planetary Health
Pest control can be done differently.
Polinesateur sont important.

Soil composition
- impact water retention, 
- capture carbon
- good for growing crops. 


### Module 5: Agrifood Systems and their Relationships to Human Health

Farmer destroy there help too fast due to the chemical. 
Working in slaughter is bad human condition too. 
Process food is bad for heath too.

Meat and cheese / milk consumption increase with GDP.
Meat increase danger of pathogen and virus like Ebola.
