[Ecosystem-based Adaptation: Working with nature to adapt to a changing climate](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:SDGAcademyX+EBA001+3T2022/home)

Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA); also known as nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation is increasingly gaining policy support and being implemented by diverse actors around the world.
EbA is defined as “the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.” 
It involves 
- the conservation, 
- sustainable management,
- and restoration of ecosystems,
- thereby enhancing the resilience of ecosystems and communities to climate-related risks. 


Here are some key take home messages.
Ecosystems and their services are important for human well-being.
Ecosystems are being destroyed and degraded
by a number of threats caused by certain human activities.
Climate change is one of these threats,
and it worsens all other threats.
As climate projections show increasingly extreme climate impacts,
it is important to take measures now
to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.
Climate change adaptation reduces the vulnerability
or increases the resilience of people to climate change.
EbA or Ecosystem-based Adaptation is the operationalisation
of Nature-based Solutions specific to climate change adaptation.
EbA has three elements.
1. It helps people adapt to climate change.
2. It uses biodiversity and ecosystem services.
3. It is part of an overall climate change adaptation strategy.
There are five criteria within these three elements.
- Criterion 1. It reduces social and environmental vulnerabilities.
- Criterion 2. It generates societal benefits in the context of climate change adaptation.
- Criterion 3. It restores, maintains or improves ecosystems and their services.
- Criterion 4. It is supported by policies at multiple levels.
- Criterion 5. It supports equitable governance and enhances capacities.



EbA has broad applications across diverse sectors in fostering sustainable development and can help achieve multiple benefits for nature and human well-being.


A key aim of the course is to increase EbA knowledge outside of the environmental conservation community, helping participants integrate EbA solutions into other sectors—including infrastructure, water, agriculture, public works, and social development—to better link research and science with practice.



Eba is distinct from Ecosystem-based Mitigation. Mitigation uses ecosystems for their service of carbon absorption and storage to aid in climate change mitigation. Mitigation is not adaptation.


EbA also has complementary approaches, namely Ecosystem-based
Disaster Risk Reduction or Eco-DRR for short.
Eco-DRR is a risk management for both climate and non climate
related hazards, including earthquakes, volcanoes,
avalanches and tsunamis.




## Module 3: The EbA Mainstreaming Framework

Pay attention that: gender role usually play an important role. 
Ex: woman in some country have distinct task
And Woman and Indiginious people may hold specific knowledge trully usefull. 

#### Conceptualising an EbA project
Consider which ecosystems you will work with.
You will learn more about this in a later unit.
What are the climatic changes occurring in the proposed project area?
Who is most at risk from climate change?
Which ecosystems are at risk from climate change?
Have a collaborative session and think about these and all the other
questions you will need to ask based on what you have learned so far.
Draw a map of the geographic boundary of the project.
This will help you visualise the spatial features
of the proposed project.
Consider communities and ecosystems together
as interconnected socio-ecological systems.
Think about socio-ecological systems in terms of climate change.
Let's say that this will be the socio-ecological system
with which you will work.
Here you try to understand the livelihood strategies of communities
and how ecosystems and the services
support livelihoods and well-being.



What are the key livelihood activities in the socio-ecological system?
How are ecosystem services important for livelihoods and well-being,
for food, fuel, cultural and spiritual values, health and shelter?
What are the ecosystems that supply important services?
This is an example of what you will learn from your analysis.
For each ecosystem you identify that will have an impact on the community you have chosen,
you will have to carry out an analysis like this.


#### climate justice
Key elements of climate justice include;
using a human rights approach, sharing benefits and burdens fairly,
ensuring that decisions on climate change are participatory,
transparent and accountable,
highlighting gender equality and equity
and using effective partnerships to secure climate justice.

## Module 4: Assessing Climate Risks
- Understand what risk assessments and the components of risk are
- Learn how to develop climate change impact chains
- Learn how these approaches can help us identify EbA options



### Assessing climate risks
the concept of risk and its three components:
- vulnerability, 
- hazards
- and exposure


### how to prepare a climate risk assessment.
Doing so involves three general steps.
1. Step one is to understand in the context of the climate risk assessment.
	1. What climate change adaptation actions are already in place or being developed?
	2. Which institutions or actors should be involved in the risk analysis?
	3. Which resources can be dedicated to conducting the climate risk assessment?
2. Step two is about identifying objectives and expected outcomes.
	1. What do we want to learn from the assessment?
	2. Where are the information gaps?
	3. What processes will the climate risk assessment support or feed into?
	4. Who is a target audience for the results of the Climate Risk Assessment?
3. Step three is to determine the focus of the risk assessment.
	1. What is the geographical scope?
	2. Will it cover the limits of a specific ecosystem such as a river watershed or a mountain forest?
	3. Or will it be linked to administrative boundaries such as a district or municipality?

We then need to identify the exact focus of the assessment.
