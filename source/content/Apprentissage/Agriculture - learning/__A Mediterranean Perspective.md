[Sustainable Food Systems: A Mediterranean Perspective](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:SDGAcademyX+SFSM001+3T2023/home)

- [ ] TAKE BETTER NOTE OF  Aquaculture and Mariculture - 4.5
	- gonna base plan on this !!!!

###### Intro
A food system consists of all the elements: environment, people, inputs, processes, infrastructures, institutions, and activities that relate to the production, processing, distribution, preparation and consumption of food and the outcomes of these activities, namely nutrition and health status, socioeconomic growth and equity and the environmental sustainability.

The Mediterranean strategy for sustainable development developed under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program, Mediterranean Action Plan; i's an adaptation of international commitments to the Mediterranean region in the context of the 2030 agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.

EU Smart Specialisation Strategy is a bottom up approach for innovation in industrial and educational policies to agriculture and Mediteranean region. 


## History of agriculture in basin and Mediterranean Diet
Agriculture was known first in the Fertile C and Egypt. Domestication of plant species included cereals, legumes, vegetables  fruits. Oil from olive trees was extracted and used for several purposes. Animals were also domesticated and used for milk and meat production.

Between 11 500 and 7 500 before JC; crops used in the Mediterranean, the main types of grains, were wheat, barley, millet and emmer. Rye and oats were not yet known for agricultural use.

Other agricultural products including sesame, which was widely cultivated and used to make oil.
Olive oil was produced in the mountains.
Flax was used to make linen cloth.
Peas were cultivated in Mesopotamia, while lentils were preferred in Palestine. 
Figs, pomegranates, apples, and pistachio groves were found throughout the Fertile Crescent.

##### Middle ages and early modern
In the M Ages, contributions to M agriculture came from Ethiopia, India, China, and other places to form new Mediterranean diets. Cereals and cheese were used with fruits and vegetables to form more diverse diets. Al Andalus introduced new crops from the new world and conveyed it to North Africa later on.

Arabic word aslo improve agriculture technic.

Carthaginians introduced the porridge made of several cereals and served it mixed with cheese, honey, and eggs.

##### Modern agriculture
After the Industrial Revolution, practices improved rapidly. The introduction of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides aimed at building intensive agricultural production systems had an impact on both food security and environmental issues.

We have to learn from history that decline and fall of ancient civilization around the Mediterranean is believed to have been strongly influenced by the demolition of natural resources and degradation of non-sustainable farming systems that resulted in deforestation and desertification.

### Rural development for poverty alleviation
95% of food production is Family Farming. family farming dominates agriculture because people have to be so self motivated, every single day to go out to their fields and look and see what is a condition in the field that day.
OR it is large corporation that brought land and farm to use economy of scale. 


## Module 4: Fisheries and Aquaculture

#### Dance of the plankton
Nowadays, over 800 million people depend directly or indirectly on marine food production for their livelihoods.
- And for many more of us seafood is the major protein source
- we crucially need sustainable and effective management strategies.
- AND we need to understand the complex processes and interactions of marine food webs that provide us with algae, crustaceans, jellyfish and fish.


Plankton need two environmental variables: sunlight and nutrients.

![[dance of planton.png]]


The deep sea is replete in nutrients, BUT light
doesn’t penetrate much below about 30 meters.

So phytoplankton mixed below that depth can’t
use those abundant nutrients for growth. As the sun warms the surface, an increasingly stable surface layer traps the nutrients and the organisms close to the sunlit layer.
-> Ideal conditions for growth. 
Phytoplankton rapidly use up the nutrients until these are at such low concentrations that growth is limited and it is only the next period of deep mixing,
bringing in new nutrients, which sets a new cycle of phytoplankton growth.

#### Marine Food Chains
Plant -> plankton -> plankton eater -> ... -> Tuna
- Plant that are really small in the ocean.
- Tuna need 5 to 6 stair in the food chain

If we eat a tuna steak of 100 grams, if it trickle...if we, if we go down all the five trophic levels back to the base of the food web of phytoplankton, we need to build up one ton of phytoplankton biomass to sustain this 100 gram steak of tuna.
Cause: 
- in each conversion when one organism eats another one, about 90% of the biomass gets lost simply by respiration, 
- by the maintenance metabolism of the organisms and only 10% of the matter get...gets transferred to the next trophic level

=> This explain why whale eat zooplankton, they become 2nd in the food chain. Hence, less lose in energy. This being the only way to sustain that big organism.  

![[chaine alimentaire - mer.png]]


BUT, this foodchain is true for plankton. Which depend on light.
When we dive deeper, the other animal start the food chain with the rest. 


#### Fisheries Economics and Management
![[fish economic.png]]


![[illegal catch.png]]
#### Aquaculture and Mariculture


Saving or protecting the fish stocks is best done by managing the fish stocks and not by replacing wild codfish by aquaculture fish.

Aquaculture VS Wild capture
![[wild capture vs aquaculture.png]]

Auaculture is actually a lot of freshwater fish. So 60% of something are cyprinids that are mainly grown in east Asia. 
Then we have a large section of crustaceans like shrimp and bivalves such as oysters and the fraction of fish is actually quite small.
So actually here the production of, of seafood in terms of harvestable fish that could alleviate the pressure on fish populations looks quite limited already.




#### Sustainable Management of Fisheries
Make quota of fish catch that can be trade. Just like stock.

## Module 5: Water resources management for Sustainable development in the Mediterranean
The 28th of July of 2010, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution
recognizing the access to clean water and sanitation as a human right.

Most of the water withdrawals occur in the agricultural sector, reaching 70% of total
water use.


More than 180 million people in the region are considered water poor. Most countries on the south and east are in water stress, with less than 1000 cubic meters per capita a year.
Some areas having less than 500 cubic meters per capita a year: a situation classed as “structural shortage.”

Also, water quality is highly affected by pollution due to human activities and concentration
of population in urban and coastal areas.


Good way to reduce water is to change consomption -> like more vegetable and fish. 

## Module 6: Sustainable farming systems under environmental and climatic constraints

Land and water degradation in North Africa ->
more stress to these regions  under pressure from global environment change.


Land degradation du to:
- population growth a and sustainable agriculture practice 
- and current droughts.
- Escalating soil erosion, 
- declining soil fertility, 
- salinization, 
- soil compaction,
- pollution,
- and desertification 


Another pressing environmental challenge is **worsening water stress and scarcity.**
- North Africa received only 9% of Africa’s total rainfall a
- nd frequent drought and inappropriate water management programs further complicate water availability.


Practice and technique that have proven their efficiency.
- Jessour
- Fixing dune
- Tanks of rain water
- Agroforestry


#### Jessour
Jessour is an ancient runoff water harvesting technique widely practiced in the arid highlands of southern Tunisia.

Jessour is the plural of jessr which is hydraulic unit made of three components: 
- the impluvium,
- the terrace
- and the tabia.

###### The impluvium, 
Or the catchment, is the area which collect and conveys runoff water.

It’s bordered by a natural water divide line.

Each unit has his own impluvium, but can also receive excess water from the upstream units.

###### The terrace
or cropping zone is the area in which farming is practiced.

It’s formed progressively by the deposition of sediments.

An artificial soil will be created which can be up to seven meters depth close to the tabia.
Generally, fruit trees, legumes, barley, and wheat are cultivated on this jessr.

PLUS Fixing sand dunes.

#### sand dunes.
When sand encroachment assumes sizable proportion, it can lead to serious economic and social problems.

It is often one of the most spectacular manifestations of desertification.

The most common way of preventing sand from advancing are formed by setting up fences,
like palm leaves directly across the path of the prevailing wind.

If winds come from direction other than that of the prevailing wind, the insulation incorporates a grid of stop lines creating squares between two successive fences.
-> Biological fixation of mobile dunes.

Once the dunes have been fixed by one of the mechanical procedures described above they can be fixed definitely by planting adapted plant species such as acacia and tamarisk.

Reforestation and biological fixation of dunes is done only when the mechanical stabilization is complete.

#### Tanks of rain water
The practice of harvesting rain water is an old tradition adopted in many parts of the world, as well as a new tradition that is growing in popularity.

Many varieties of rain water harvesting systems have been developed in arid and semiarid areas and can serve as a primary or supplementary water resource.

Tanks are constructed to supply the rural community which water for various domestic use including drinking water supply, for the livestock watering in the range lands.

The flexibility and the many benefits associated with rain water harvesting, like low creation and maintenance costs, make it widely accepted and increasingly promoted alternative for the water demands.

#### Agroforestry
Agroforestry is a land use type where crops and tree are grown together in the same place and the same time.

Agroforestry systems have the advantage of providing multiple products, 
- example: wood and fruit or service.
	- service such as: biodiversity enhancement, erosion control, while still maintaining agricultural production.

It has the advantage to restore carbon in the biomass of the tree and to also increase soil organic carbon stocks.

###### A trial in southern France.
Hybrid walnut trees are incorporated with durum wheat.

So organic carbon stocks were measured on 200 soil cores down to two meters soil depth. And practical size fraction was performed on 64 soil samples.

Carbon stocks of tree, and of the herberous vegetations in the tree rows were also qualified. Results showed that the agroforestry system provide high amount of carbon at depth and the other agricultural practice like no till farming and could therefore provide more stable carbon storage in the long-term.

## Module 8: Reducing food waste and enhancing by-product innovations
About 795 million people still suffer from hunger. So, it is unacceptable that more than 30% of the food produced worldwide for human consumption is lost or wasted along the food supply chain or ends up in landfills.


The challenges that contribute to food loss and food waste through the food supply chain are challenges through harvesting, drying, storage, processing, distribution, and at the consumer stages. During harvesting stage, failure to meet optimal pre-harvest condition, for example, harvesting before maturity and inappropriate handling, increase the risk of loss due to pest or mold development, or the edible crops are sometimes be left into soil and are eaten by pests. Also inappropriate harvesting method cause a crop damage.

At drying stage most of smallholder farmers in developing countries rely sun drying to ensure that their crop is sufficiently dry for storage.
If weather conditions are too cloudy, humid, or even wet, then the crop will not be dried sufficiently, and losses will be high. Effective dryers can minimize damage to the crop caused by effective drying practices, which accounts for approximately 5% of loss in volume across the commodity.


In the initial processing and industrial processing stage, the causes of waste are mostly technical failure, leading to losses and damage to the products, which are then rejected. This happens most often in developing countries, where technology is often inadequate and cannot ensure the proper product conservation. Errors during food processing procedures cause defects in terms of weight, shape, or packaging of the product, even though this defects have no effect on the safety or initial nutritional value of the product, they are rejected. In the distribution and sale stages for both wholesaler and retailer of distribution, waste is generated due to damage to the product, packaging during transportation, and storage.

At consumer level, the causes of waste are leftovers, products with past expiry date, product with past used by date, impulse buying, bulk purchasing, and poor portioning. It could be noticed that about 50% of what they buy from salads are thrown away, while 20% of bread in bakeries is wasted



## Module 9:  Nutrition and Education
Goal: 
- Epidemic of obesity and 
	- cardiovascular disease, cancer, but also digestive disease or cognitive malfunction
- the definition of a model of balanced diet able to promote health at the population level.


People do not get enough of vitamins and
proteins and minerals.

Have people obese but with malnutrition.

healthy lifestyle is the only answer to solve this problem of the obesity epidemics, of this chronic degenerative disease which are so common all over the world.

We should promote whole foods instead of refined foods, so whole grain instead of refined grain, and we should promote dietary patterns instead of mono factorial change (such as medicament).


###### Old Meditarean diet
The Mediterranean diet was based mostly on vegetables products.

Vegetable and fruit were always present on the table, together with cereals, pasta, whole wheat bread, legumes, nuts and olive oil.
Fish was also very much present in the diet.

Conversely, meat, dairy products and animal fat were also utilized, but only occasionally. Olive oil was the major condiment in this type of diet.

One or two glasses of wine were also permitted in the Mediterranean diet.
