### **LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR THE INTRODUCTION TO BONES**

1. Define the term "skeleton"
2. Explain the differences between t**he axial skeleton** and the **appendicular skeleton**
	1. also: **single bone** VS **bones part of a serie**
3. List the bones of 
	1. the upper limb
	2. the lower limb
4. 3 basic region of a long bone (appendicular skeleton)
5. Describe the basic **biomechanical stresses on musculoskeletal tissus*


###### Vocabulary
**girdle:** it is derived from the Latin, singulum, which is a belt or support. There are 2: 
- shoulder girdle
- pelvis girdle

**articulation:** which means a joint. It's just a fancy Latin name for a joint. But the Latin itself means a formation of vines.


**skeleton:** is defined as all the bone in the body, which count for 214 (*including the tiny little bones in the middle ear*).


vertebrates, like ourselves, we have an endoskeleton,
which means that the bones are not at the surface of the body.
But the pattern in insects and crustaceans
is to have an exoskeleton, which means that the bones will be on the outside.


The bones of the **axial skeleton** are the central bones of the head, the neck, and the trunk.

the other division of the skeleton is the **appendicular skeleton**. and another term for the upper and the lower limb-- a generic term-- is the "appendages."



### Join objective 
- the difference between synovial joints, fibrous joints, and cartilaginous joints.
- escribe the configuration of the major synovial joint types, and you'll be able to describe the three basic motion axes permitted at ball-and-socket joints.
	- Ball-and-socket joints are the most mobile of the synovial joints.



**Joints** are defined as the unions between two or more bones or cartilages.
Joints are classified according to the type
of connective tissue uniting the bones.


Fibrous joints unite the bones of the skull, attach the teeth to the jaws, form substantial membranes between the radius and the ulna in the upper limb and the fibula and tibia in the lower limb.

Cartilage unites bones meeting at cartilaginous joints and, again, fills the spaces between them. Cartilaginous joints unite the hip bones anteriorly at the pubic symphysis and form part of the inner vertebral disks uniting vertebrae.



Motion at fibrous joints and cartilaginous joints
is limited to compression, stretching, bending,
and twisting of the connective tissue.
Either the fibrous connective tissue or the cartilage
in the cartilaginous joints.
And so it's only deformation of this connective tissue in one direction
or another that enables them to move.
VS synovial joints who allow for greater mobility.


The standard features of all synovial joints
include a joint cavity, which in itself allows for greater mobility.
The bones can slide against one another rather than having a plate of tissue
to form.


## On joints

Joints are defined as the unions between two or more bones or cartilages.
Joints are classified according to the type
of connective tissue uniting the bones.
Fibrous connective tissue unites bones meeting at fibrous joints
and also fills the spaces between them.
Fibrous joints unite the bones of the skull, attach the teeth to the jaws,
form substantial membranes between the radius
and the ulna in the upper limb and the fibula and tibia in the lower limb.
Cartilage unites bones meeting at cartilaginous joints
and, again, fills the spaces between them.
Cartilaginous joints unite the hip bones anteriorly
at the pubic symphysis and form part of the inner vertebral disks uniting
vertebrae.
Cartilaginous growth plates called epiphysis form temporary cartilaginous
joints in developing long bones.


### on type of muscle
**Types of muscle**: The three types of muscle in the human body are smooth, cardiac, and skeletal.

---

**Smooth muscle**: Smooth muscle is capable of slow, sustained contraction. It is found in hollow organs, the walls of blood vessels, and in the skin (which makes hairs stand on end). Smooth muscle cells are usually narrow and spindle-shaped. Their nuclei are single and centrally located, and their cytoplasm evidences no visible striations. 

---

**Cardiac muscle**: Capable of repeated contractions without fatiguing, cardiac muscle is found in the walls of the heart. Cardiac muscle cells are branching cells, with junctions called intercalated discs. They are arranged in a spiral in the heart to wring blood out the top.

---

**Skeletal muscle**: Skeletal muscle tissue forms the familiar muscles of the musculoskeletal system, such as the biceps and triceps. Skeletal muscle cells are capable of forceful contraction. These cells are arranged roughly in parallel to one another; they display conspicuous repeating striations in the cytoplasm and tend to be very long and mutlinucleated.

---

**Unipennate muscle**: These muscles have fibers that run the entire length of only one side of the muscle, like a quill.

---

**Bipennate muscle**: This consists of two rows of oblique muscle fibers, facing in opposite diagonal directions and converging on a tendon.

---

**Deep fascia**: Layers of fibrous connective tissue which surround individual muscles. They divide muscles into compartments.

---

**Fusiform muscle**: This type of muscle is cylindrically shaped in the center and tapers at the ends.

---

**Contraction**: Muscle contractions are accomplished through the interaction of actin and myosin. There are three main types: Isometric, isotonic, and tonic.

---

**Tonic contraction**: A slight but sustained muscle contraction, e.g., maintaining one's posture.

---

**Isotonic contraction**: In this contraction, the muscle shortens against a constant load to produce movement.

---

**Isometric contraction**: In this contraction, the muscle tension increases as the muscle maintains a fixed overall length.


### on nerves
**Meninges**: The membranes that envelop the central nervous system.

---

**Dura mater**: A thick membrane that is the outermost of the three layers of the meninges.

---

**Pia mater**: The innermost layer of the meninges.

---

**Arachnoid mater**: The layer interposed between the other two layers of the meninges.

---

**Central nervous system**: Comprises the brain and spinal cord. Does not include the cranial nerves or spinal nerves.

---

**Peripheral nervous system**: Includes the cranial nerves and spinal nerves. Does not include the spinal cord or brain.

---

**Brain**: Lies within the cranial cavity, surrounded by the skull.

---

**Spinal cord**: Lies within the vertebral canal surrounded by the spine (vertebrae) and intervertebral discs.

---

---

**Spinal nerves**: Emerge from various segments of the spinal cord. There are 31 pairs total.

---

**Cranial nerves**: Leave and enter the cranial cavity through small passages in the skull.

---

**Cerebrospinal fluid**: A fluid that fills the space between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater.

---

**Artery**: A blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart toward tissues.

---

**Vein**: A blood vessel that carries blood toward the heart from the tissue capillary beds. 

---

**Pulmonary circulation**: The process through which the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs.

**Aorta**: An artery that carries blood from the heart to the extensive arterial network that ends in capillary beds in the body.

---

**Superior vena cava**: A vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body to the right atrium of the heart.

---

**Inferior vena cava**: A large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body to the right atrium of the heart.

### terminology of examination
**Physical Examination**: May include the following steps when a patient manifests a potential injury or disease:

- Inspection (noting signs of injury)
- Palpation (examination with the hands)

## Connective/Supporting Tissue

The general category **connective/supportive tissue** includes a diverse group of tissues from the ubiquitous loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue found in many regions of the body to more specialized musculoskeletal connective tissues, cartilage and bone.

**All connective/supporting tissues consist of cells and the extracellular matrix synthesized and maintained by those cells**. The extracellular matrix of each connective tissue type is a customized formula consisting of insoluble protein fibers, such as collagen and elastin, embedded in a ground substance, a hydrated meshwork of protein and carbohydrate molecules. Differences in the organization and composition of the extracellular matrix determine differences in the physical properties of the different connective tissue types. For example, the watery extracellular matrix of cartilage makes it resilient and compliant. The mineralized extracellular matrix of bone makes it rigid and strong.

#### Connective/supporting tissue cells

As manufacturing cells, connecting/supportive tissue cells have all the **features of actively synthesizing cells** that you learned about in the _Introduction to Cells, Tissues, and Organization_ module. These cellular features include large nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant mitochondria and Golgi complexes in the cell cytoplasm.

In loose connective tissue and dense connective tissue, **fibroblasts** synthesize the ground substance and the collagen and elastic fibers of the extracellular matrix. **Fibrocytes** are the inactive or resting forms of fibroblasts. You will study fibrocytes, loose connective tissue, and dense connective tissue, in the _Tissues and Organization_ module for Case 2.

In cartilage, the actively synthesizing cells are **chondroblasts** and the inactive forms are **chondrocytes**.

In bone, the actively synthesizing cells are **osteoblasts** and the inactive forms are **osteocytes**. Bone is constantly remodelling in response to external forces. **Osteoclasts**, another cell type found in bone, function in bone breakdown and resorption. Normally, the amount of bone resorbed by osteoclasts is roughly equal to the amount of bone synthesized by osteoblasts, and the bone remodelling process proceeds in equilibrium. You will study chondrocytes and osteocytes in this module.

#### Extracellular matrix fibers

The **insoluble protein fibers** in the extracellular matrix of connective/supporting tissue are primarily collagen and elastic fibers. The cells in each type of connective tissue synthesize the fibers and ground substance required for the function of the connective tissue type.

**Collagen** is the most abundant protein in the body. Over 20 different collagen types have been described. As you learned in your study of the parotid gland, type I collagen fibers appear pink in tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Coarse **type I collagen fibers** are found in loose connective tissue, dense connective tissue, fibrous cartilage, bone, skin, tendons, ligaments, joint capsules, fascia, the outer portions of the intervertebral discs, the capsules and partitions of solid organs, and the supporting layers of hollow organs.

Fine **type II collagen** **fibers** are found in hyaline cartilage and elastic cartilage, and in the inner portion of the intervertebral discs.

Branching, delicate **type III collagen** **fibers** form the delicate **reticular fiber** meshwork supporting active cells in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.

Thin, branching **elastic fibers** are found in many connective tissues, but elastic fibers are visible only when special stains are used to prepare the tissue sections. Elastic fibers are conspicuous in elastic cartilage and in the walls of organs that frequently change size and shape, such as the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and the large elastic arteries leaving the heart.

#### Extracellular matrix ground substance

Connective tissue cells and fibers are suspended in a **ground substance**, a hydrated, semifluid gel. The ground substance consists of three components.

**Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)** are unbranched polysaccharide chains. Negatively charged glycosaminoglycans repel other glycosaminoglycans, attract water and cations, and establish electrostatic bonds with collagen fibers, thereby maintaining the expanded, hydrated gel meshwork of the extracellular matrix.

**Proteoglycan aggregates** consist of glycosaminoglycans bound to a core protein.

**Adhesive glycoproteins** bind the connective tissue cells, proteoglycan aggregates, and protein fibers of the extracellular matrix.

The hydrated ground substance of most connective tissue allows the **exchange** of oxygen, water-soluble nutrients, and metabolites between nearby blood vessels and connective tissue cells. The relatively low water content and mineralized extracellular matrix of bone requires a different delivery and exchange system to meet the metabolic requirements of bone cells.
